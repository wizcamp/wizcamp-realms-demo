# Student Instructions - Wizcamp Realms: Legends of Trivia

Welcome to your React development journey! You'll be building an interactive trivia game over 12 sessions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Step 1: Launch Your Codespace
1. **Navigate to**: `https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=wizcamp/wizcamp-realms-demo`
2. **Click**: "Create new codespace"
3. **Wait**: For Codespace to build (Dark Dracula theme loads automatically)
4. **Run**: `npm run dev` in the terminal
5. **Port Notification**: When you see "Your application running on port 5173 is available" ‚Üí Click **"Open in Browser"** (NOT "Make Public") or visit http://localhost:5173/
6. **Follow the on-screen instructions** to swap `<StartHere />` for `<SplashScreen />` and experience hot module reloading
7. **Optional**: Configure terminal settings to send keybindings to shell
8. **Optional**: Allow sharing of clipboard when prompted

### Step 2: Understand the Project Structure
- `src/App.jsx` - Main app component (starts with placeholder)
- `src/components/` - Individual UI pieces
- `src/context/GameContext.jsx` - Shared game state
- `src/data/zones.js` - Game configuration
- `public/` - Images, audio, and other assets

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tips

### Essential Commands
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server (use this most!)
npm run format       # Clean up your code formatting
```

### üí° Codespaces Tips

**Terminal Keybindings**: If you see a message about "keybindings don't go to the terminal," click "Configure Terminal Settings" and enable "Send Keybindings to Shell" for smoother terminal experience.

**Everything Configured**: Dark Dracula theme, extensions, and formatting are pre-configured - no manual setup needed!

### React DevTools
1. Install React DevTools browser extension
2. Use Components tab to inspect state
3. Great for debugging Context and props

### Getting Help
- Read the TODO comments in each file
- Use console.log() to debug
- Ask questions during sessions
- Experiment and break things (that's how you learn!)
