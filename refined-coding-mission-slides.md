## Rationale for Changes

### More Accurate Descriptions
- **"Launch Your Development Journey"** - More accurately describes the foundational setup nature of Session 1
- **"Build Your First Custom Component"** - Emphasizes the milestone of creating original components
- **"Master State-Driven Navigation"** - Focuses on the core concept rather than generic "navigation"
- **"Design Your Game World"** - Captures the creative, architectural aspect of zone configuration
- **"Connect to Real Internet Data"** - Emphasizes the significance of API integration
- **"Build Lightning-Fast Performance"** - Highlights the performance benefits of caching
- **"Create Engaging Quiz Interactions"** - Focuses on user experience rather than just "interactive"
- **"Build Complete Game Logic"** - Emphasizes the comprehensive nature of scoring and victory systems

### More Engaging Language
- Uses action verbs that convey achievement and progress
- Emphasizes the value and impact of what students are building
- Connects to the bigger picture of professional development
- Avoids generic "Let's [verb]" pattern in favor of specific, motivating descriptions

### Professional Context
- Language reflects the complexity and importance of the concepts
- Emphasizes skills that transfer to real-world development
- Positions students as builders and creators, not just followers

## Implementation Notes

These refined titles should replace the current "Today's Coding Mission" slide titles in each SESSION-XX-instruction.md file. The content of each slide can remain the same - only the main title needs updating to be more accurate and engaging.
