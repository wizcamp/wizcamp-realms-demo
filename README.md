# Fullstack Explorer: Trivia Game Edition

Welcome to your React development journey! You'll be building an interactive trivia game over 12 sessions using modern web development tools and techniques.

## 🎯 For Students

### 🚀 Quick Start - Launch Your Game!

**After your Codespace loads, run this command in the terminal:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Then click "Open in Browser" when the port notification appears!**

---

### Complete Setup Steps

1. **Navigate to**: `https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=wizcamp/wizcamp-realms-demo`
2. **Click**: "Create new codespace"
3. **Wait**: For Codespace to build (Dark Dracula theme loads automatically)
4. **🚀 RUN**: `npm run dev` in the terminal
5. **Port Notification**: When you see "Your application running on port 5173 is available" → Click **"Open in Browser"** (NOT "Make Public") or visit http://localhost:5173/
6. **Follow the on-screen instructions** to swap `<StartHere />` for `<SplashScreen />` and experience hot module reloading
7. **Optional**: Allow sharing of clipboard when prompted

### Essential Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server (use this most!)
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build
npm run format       # Clean up your code formatting
npm run format:check # Check code formatting
```

### React DevTools

1. Install React DevTools browser extension
2. Use Components tab to inspect state and props
3. Great for debugging Context and component hierarchy

### Getting Help

- **Check session-guides/** folder for detailed step-by-step instructions
- Read TODO comments in each file for guidance
- Use console.log() for debugging
- Ask questions during sessions
- Experiment and break things (that's how you learn!)
