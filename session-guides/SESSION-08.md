## üß† Understanding Application State

Before we dive into scoring, let's understand how **application state** differs from the component state you've used before.

**Application state** is the complete picture of your game's current condition ‚Äî everything from the player's score to which zones are completed. Think of it as your game's "save file" that tracks all progress and achievements.

### State Categories in Your Game

Your GameContext manages five categories of state:

| Category | Purpose | Examples |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Game State** | Core game progress | `score`, `screen`, `zoneProgress` |
| **Quiz State** | Current quiz session | `currentQuestions`, `currentQuestion`, `correctAnswers` |
| **Audio** | Sound controls | `music` settings |
| **Actions** | Game logic functions | `recordCorrectAnswer`, `resetGame` |
| **Controls** | UI state setters | `setScreen`, `setIsQuizVisible` |

### üí° Why This Matters

**Application state management** is what separates simple websites from complex, interactive applications. Your scoring system will coordinate multiple pieces of state to create a cohesive game experience where every action has consequences and every achievement is tracked.

<a id="adding-score-tracking"></a>

## üèÜ Adding Score Tracking

Let's add a scoring system that tracks player performance and displays it prominently in your game's HUD.

1. **Open `src/context/GameContext.jsx`** and add score state inside the GameProvider function:

   ```javascript
   const [score, setScore] = useState(0); // Add score state
   ```

2. **Make score available** by adding it to the Context value:

   ```javascript
   <GameContext value={{
     // GAME STATE
     screen,
     score, // Add score to make available
     zoneProgress,
     // ... rest of existing properties
   ```

3. **Open `src/components/HUD.jsx`** and add a Scoreboard component at the top of the file:

   ```javascript
   function Scoreboard() { // Add Scoreboard component
     const { score } = useGame();
     return <div className="score-display">Score: {score}</div>;
   }
   ```

4. **Update HUD to render both components** using a React Fragment (`<>...</>`):

   ```javascript
   // Replace this single line:
   return <CurrentZone />;
   
   // With this Fragment structure:
   return (
     <>
       <Scoreboard /> // Add Scoreboard
       <CurrentZone />
     </>
   );
   ```

5. **Test**: Navigate to the game screen ‚Üí Score: 0 appears in HUD

### üí° Why This Matters

The **Scoreboard component** demonstrates the single responsibility principle ‚Äî it has one job: display the current score. This modular approach makes your code easier to maintain and test.

<a id="implementing-score-updates"></a>

## üìä Implementing Score Updates

Now let's make the score actually change based on player performance with point rewards and penalties.

1. **Open `src/context/GameContext.jsx`** and find the `recordCorrectAnswer` function, then add points for correct answers:

   ```javascript
   const recordCorrectAnswer = () => {
     setCorrectAnswers((prev) => prev + 1);
     setScore((prev) => prev + POINTS_PER_CORRECT); // Add score increase
   };
   ```

2. **Find the `recordIncorrectAnswer` function** and add point deduction:

   ```javascript
   const recordIncorrectAnswer = () => {
     setScore((prev) => Math.max(0, prev - POINTS_PER_CORRECT)); // Add score decrease with floor
   };
   ```

3. **Test**: Click zone ‚Üí Answer questions ‚Üí Observe score changes:

   - **Correct answer** ‚Üí +100 points
   - **Incorrect answer** ‚Üí -100 points (but never below 0)

### üí° Why This Matters

**Updater functions** like `setScore((prev) => prev + 100)` are crucial when updating state based on the previous value. React batches state updates, so using the previous value ensures accurate calculations even when multiple updates happen quickly.

<a id="adding-cache-clearing"></a>

## üóÑÔ∏è Adding Cache Clearing

Let's add cache clearing functions to remove stored questions when zones are completed or the game resets.

1. **Open `src/services/trivia.js`** and add cache clearing functions at the end of the file:

   ```javascript
   export function clearQuestionCache(zoneId) { // Add cache clearing for single zone
     const cacheKey = getCacheKey(zoneId);
     localStorage.removeItem(cacheKey);
   }

   export function clearAllQuestionCache() { // Add cache clearing for all zones
     Object.keys(localStorage)
       .filter((key) => key.startsWith("trivia_questions_zone_"))
       .forEach((key) => localStorage.removeItem(key));
   }
   ```

2. **Import the cache functions** into GameContext.jsx:

   ```javascript
   import { 
     fetchQuestions, 
     clearQuestionCache, 
     clearAllQuestionCache 
   } from "../services/trivia"; // Add cache functions
   ```

3. **Update the `checkZoneCompletion` function** to clear the current zone's cached questions when completed:

   ```javascript
   const checkZoneCompletion = () => {
     if (activeZone === null || currentQuestions.length === 0) return;

     const questionsNeeded = Math.ceil(
       currentQuestions.length * PASS_PERCENTAGE
     );
     const passed = correctAnswers >= questionsNeeded;

     if (passed) {
       setZoneProgress((prev) => ({
         ...prev,
         [activeZone]: { completed: true },
       }));
       
       clearQuestionCache(activeZone); // Add cache clearing

       if (activeZone === ZONES.length - 1) {
         setScreen(SCREENS.GAME_OVER);
       }
     }
   };
   ```

### üí° Why This Matters

**Cache management** prevents stale data from affecting gameplay. When players complete a zone, clearing its cache ensures they get fresh questions if they replay. The `Object.keys()` and `filter()` pattern is a professional way to find and remove related localStorage entries.

<a id="updating-reset-functionality"></a>

## üîÑ Updating Reset Functionality

Let's update the reset function to properly clear all game state and cached data for a fresh start.

1. **Find the `resetGame` function** in GameContext.jsx and update it:

   ```javascript
   const resetGame = () => {
     setScore(0); // Add score reset
     setZoneProgress({
       0: { completed: false },
       1: { completed: false },
       2: { completed: false },
     });
     setIsQuizVisible(false);
     setCurrentQuestions([]);
     setCurrentQuestion(0);
     setCorrectAnswers(0);
     clearAllQuestionCache(); // Add cache clearing
   };
   ```

2. **Test the reset functionality** by completing a zone and then using React DevTools to trigger `resetGame()`

### üí° Why This Matters

**Complete state reset** ensures players can start fresh without any lingering data from previous games. This includes both React state and localStorage cache, providing a clean slate for new gameplay sessions.

## üéñÔ∏è Solo Mission: GameOver Component

Now for the exciting part ‚Äî you'll create a GameOver component that celebrates player achievements and allows them to play again! You've got all the tools ‚Äî now it's time to build your own victory screen using everything you've learned.

### 1. Create the Component Foundation

- Create `src/components/GameOver.jsx` with function component and default export
- Return JSX with div `className="game-over"` containing h1 congratulations message
- Import `GameOver` into `App.jsx` and add conditional rendering for `SCREENS.GAME_OVER`
- **Test**: Use React DevTools ‚Üí Set `screen` to "gameover" ‚Üí Component appears

### 2. Add Score Display

- Import `useGame` hook and destructure `score`
- Add div with `className="final-score"` displaying `Final Score: {score}`
- **Test**: Check score display ‚Üí Shows current game score

### 3. Add Play Again Functionality

- Create click handler calling `resetGame` and `setScreen(SCREENS.SPLASH)`
- Import and render `GameButton` with "Play Again" text and `"primary"` variant
- **Test**: Click Play Again ‚Üí Game resets ‚Üí Returns to splash screen

### Testing Tips

- **Quick testing**: Use React DevTools to change `screen` state to "gameover" (find `GameProvider` ‚Üí hooks ‚Üí screen)
- **Full testing**: Complete all three zones to naturally trigger GameOver screen
- **Verify**: Final score displays correctly and Play Again button resets everything

### **Requirements Checklist**

Your completed GameOver component must:

- Export function component as default
- Wrap content in div with `className="game-over"`
- Display congratulations using h1 element
- Import `GameButton`, `useGame`, `SCREENS`
- Show final score in div with `className="final-score"`
- Include Play Again button using `GameButton` with `"primary"` variant
- Reset game and navigate to splash screen when Play Again is clicked
- Display when screen state equals `SCREENS.GAME_OVER` in `App.jsx`

### üîç Reference Files

- **`SplashScreen.jsx`**: Component structure, `GameButton` usage, `useGame` hook, screen navigation, click handler patterns
- **`HUD.jsx`**: Accessing `score` from `useGame` hook
- **Session 2 guide**: `GameButton` props and component export patterns
- **Session 3 guide**: `SCREENS` constants and navigation patterns

### üí° Why This Matters

This challenge combines everything you've learned: component creation, props, shared state, event handling, and conditional rendering. Following guided steps without code examples builds confidence in applying React patterns ‚Äî you're connecting concepts rather than copying code.
