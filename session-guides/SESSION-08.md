## üß† Application State

Before we dive into scoring, let's understand how **application state** differs from the component state you've used before.

**Application state** is the complete picture of your game's current condition ‚Äî everything from the player's score to which zones are completed. Think of it as your game's "save file" that tracks all progress and achievements.

Your `GameContext` manages five categories of state:

| Category | Purpose | Examples |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Game State** | Core game progress | `score`, `screen`, `zoneProgress` |
| **Quiz State** | Current quiz session | `currentQuestions`, `currentQuestion`, `correctAnswers` |
| **Audio** | Sound controls | `music` settings |
| **Actions** | Game logic functions | `recordCorrectAnswer`, `resetGame` |
| **Controls** | UI state setters | `setScreen`, `setIsQuizVisible` |

Think of your `GameContext` as the brain of your game ‚Äî it keeps track of everything that's happening behind the scenes. The `useGame` hook provides access to this brain from any component that needs it. The mind map below breaks down how your game's state is organized, with a spotlight on **actions** ‚Äî these are the functions that drive your game logic and help different parts of your app work together:

Managing application state is what separates simple websites from complex, interactive applications. Your scoring system will coordinate multiple pieces of state to create a cohesive game experience where every action has consequences and every achievement is tracked.

<a id="adding-score-tracking"></a>

## üèÜ Adding Score Tracking

üéØ **Goal:** Add a scoring system that tracks player performance and displays it prominently in your game's HUD.

You'll add score state to GameContext, expose it through the Context value, create a Scoreboard component, and integrate it into the HUD.

### Step 1: Add score state

**File:** `src/context/GameContext.jsx`

Add score state to track player performance throughout the game.

```javascript
export function GameProvider({ children }) {
  const [screen, setScreen] = useState(SCREENS.SPLASH);
  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);  // Add score state
  
  // ... rest of state declarations
```

> üí° **Understanding useState**
>
> `useState` is a React hook that lets your component remember things ‚Äî like a score ‚Äî between renders. It gives you:
>
> - **A current value** (`score`) that starts at `0`
> - **A setter function** (`setScore`) that can be used to update the value and trigger a re-render

### Step 2: Share score with all components

**File:** `src/context/GameContext.jsx`

Make score available to all components by adding it to the Context value object.

```javascript
export function GameProvider({ children }) {
  // ... state declarations ...
  
  return (
    <GameContext
      value={{
        // GAME STATE
        screen,
        score,  // Add score to value
        zoneProgress,
        // ... rest of properties
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </GameContext>
  );
}
```

> üí° **Understanding How State Is Shared**
>
> In Step 1, you created `score` as local state.
>
> By adding it to the Context value here, you make it available across your app.
>
> Now any component that calls `useGame()` can access `score` ‚Äî no prop-drilling needed.

### Step 3: Create Scoreboard component

**File:** `src/components/HUD.jsx`

Create a new component that displays the score from shared state.

```javascript
// Add import at top of file:
import { useGame } from "../hooks/useGame";  // [1] Import useGame hook

// Add after imports:
function Scoreboard() {
  const { score } = useGame();  // [2] Get score from shared state
  return <div className="score-display">Score: {score}</div>;  // [3] Display score
}
```

> üí° **Understanding Shared State Access**
>
> 1. **Import useGame hook**: Access the shared game state from Context
> 2. **Get score from shared state**: Destructure the score value from GameContext
> 3. **Display score**: Render the score in a styled div
>
> The Scoreboard component accesses the score directly from shared state using the `useGame` hook. This means any component can display or use the score without passing it through props. When the score updates in GameContext, all components using it automatically re-render with the new value.

### Step 4: Add Scoreboard to HUD

**File:** `src/components/HUD.jsx`

Update the HUD component to render both Scoreboard and CurrentZone using a React Fragment.

```javascript
// Before:
export default function HUD() {
  return <CurrentZone />;
}

// After:
export default function HUD() {
  return (
    <>
      <Scoreboard />
      <CurrentZone />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Step 5: Test score display

Navigate to the game screen.

**‚úì You should see:** "Score: 0" appears in the HUD above the current zone display.

<a id="implementing-score-updates"></a>

## üìä Implementing Score Updates

üéØ **Goal:** Make the score change based on player performance with point rewards and penalties.

You'll update the `recordCorrectAnswer` and `recordIncorrectAnswer` functions to modify the score when players answer questions.

### Step 1: Add points for correct answers

**File:** `src/context/GameContext.jsx`

Update the `recordCorrectAnswer` function to award points when players answer correctly.

```javascript
const recordCorrectAnswer = () => {
  setCorrectAnswers((prev) => prev + 1);
  setScore((prev) => prev + POINTS_PER_CORRECT);  // Add points
};
```

### Step 2: Add point deduction for incorrect answers

**File:** `src/context/GameContext.jsx`

Update the `recordIncorrectAnswer` function to deduct points, preventing negative scores.

```javascript
const recordIncorrectAnswer = () => {
  setScore((prev) => Math.max(0, prev - POINTS_PER_CORRECT));  // Deduct points
};
```

### Step 3: Test score updates

Click a zone, then answer questions.

**‚úì You should see:**
- Correct answer ‚Üí Score increases by 100 points
- Incorrect answer ‚Üí Score decreases by 100 points (but never below 0)

> üí° **Updater Functions**
>
> **Updater functions** like `setScore((prev) => prev + 100)` are crucial when updating state based on the previous value. React batches state updates for performance, so using the previous value ensures accurate calculations even when multiple updates happen quickly. Without the updater function, you might lose updates or get incorrect values.

<a id="adding-cache-clearing"></a>

## üóÑÔ∏è Adding Cache Clearing

üéØ **Goal:** Add cache clearing functions to remove stored questions when zones are completed or the game resets.

You'll create functions to clear individual zone caches and all caches, then integrate them into your game flow.

### Step 1: Create cache clearing functions

**File:** `src/services/trivia.js`

Add cache clearing functions at the end of the file.

```javascript
export function clearQuestionCache(zoneId) {
  const cacheKey = getCacheKey(zoneId);
  localStorage.removeItem(cacheKey);
}

export function clearAllQuestionCache() {
  Object.keys(localStorage)
    .filter((key) => key.startsWith("trivia_questions_zone_"))
    .forEach((key) => localStorage.removeItem(key));
}
```

### Step 2: Import cache functions into GameContext

**File:** `src/context/GameContext.jsx`

Add the cache clearing functions to your imports.

```javascript
import { 
  fetchQuestions, 
  clearQuestionCache, 
  clearAllQuestionCache 
} from "../services/trivia";
```

### Step 3: Clear cache on zone completion

**File:** `src/context/GameContext.jsx`

Update the `checkZoneCompletion` function to clear the zone's cache when completed.

```javascript
const checkZoneCompletion = () => {
  if (activeZone === null || currentQuestions.length === 0) return;

  const questionsNeeded = Math.ceil(
    currentQuestions.length * PASS_PERCENTAGE
  );
  const passed = correctAnswers >= questionsNeeded;

  if (passed) {
    setZoneProgress((prev) => ({
      ...prev,
      [activeZone]: { completed: true },
    }));
    
    clearQuestionCache(activeZone);  // Clear zone cache

    if (activeZone === ZONES.length - 1) {
      setScreen(SCREENS.GAME_OVER);
    }
  }
};
```

### Step 4: Test cache clearing

Complete a zone, then check localStorage in browser DevTools.

**‚úì You should see:** The cache entry for the completed zone is removed from localStorage.

> üí° **Cache Management**
>
> Cache management prevents stale data from affecting gameplay. When players complete a zone, clearing its cache ensures they get fresh questions if they replay. The `Object.keys()` and `filter()` pattern is an effective way to find and remove related localStorage entries by matching key prefixes.

<a id="updating-reset-functionality"></a>

## üîÑ Updating Reset Functionality

üéØ **Goal:** Update the reset function to properly clear all game state and cached data for a fresh start.

You'll modify the `resetGame` function to reset all state variables and clear the question cache.

### Step 1: Update resetGame function

**File:** `src/context/GameContext.jsx`

Update the `resetGame` function to reset all state and clear caches.

```javascript
const resetGame = () => {
  setScore(0);
  setZoneProgress({
    0: { completed: false },
    1: { completed: false },
    2: { completed: false },
  });
  setIsQuizVisible(false);
  setCurrentQuestions([]);
  setCurrentQuestion(0);
  setCorrectAnswers(0);
  clearAllQuestionCache();
};
```

### Step 2: Test reset functionality

Complete a zone, then use React DevTools to trigger `resetGame()`.

**‚úì You should see:** All state resets to initial values and localStorage cache is cleared.

> üí° **Complete State Reset**
>
> Complete state reset ensures players can start fresh without any lingering data from previous games. This includes both React state and localStorage cache, providing a clean slate for new gameplay sessions. Resetting all related state together prevents bugs where some state is stale while other state is fresh.
