## üß† Application State

Before we dive into scoring, let's understand how **application state** differs from the component state you've used before.

**Application state** is the complete picture of your game's current condition ‚Äî everything from the player's score to which zones are completed. Think of it as your game's "save file" that tracks all progress and achievements.

Your `GameContext` manages five categories of state:

| Category | Purpose | Examples |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Game State** | Core game progress | `score`, `screen`, `zoneProgress` |
| **Quiz State** | Current quiz session | `currentQuestions`, `currentQuestion`, `correctAnswers` |
| **Audio** | Sound controls | `music` settings |
| **Actions** | Game logic functions | `recordCorrectAnswer`, `resetGame` |
| **Controls** | UI state setters | `setScreen`, `setIsQuizVisible` |

Think of your `GameContext` as the brain of your game ‚Äî it keeps track of everything that's happening behind the scenes. The `useGame` hook provides access to this brain from any component that needs it. The mind map below breaks down how your game's state is organized, with a spotlight on **actions** ‚Äî these are the functions that drive your game logic and help different parts of your app work together:

*Figure: GameContext Mind Map*

Managing application state is what separates simple websites from complex, interactive applications. Your scoring system will coordinate multiple pieces of state to create a cohesive game experience where every action has consequences and every achievement is tracked.

<a id="adding-score-tracking"></a>

## üèÜ Adding Score Tracking

üéØ **Goal:** Add a scoring system that tracks player performance and displays it prominently in your game's HUD.

You'll add score state to GameContext, expose it through the Context value, create a Scoreboard component, and integrate it into the HUD.

### Step 1: Add score state

**File:** `src/context/GameContext.jsx`

Add score state to track player performance throughout the game.

```javascript
export function GameProvider({ children }) {
  const [screen, setScreen] = useState(SCREENS.SPLASH);
  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);  // Add score state
  
  // ... rest of state declarations
```

> üí° **Understanding useState**
>
> `useState` is a React hook that lets your component remember things ‚Äî like a score ‚Äî between renders. It gives you:
>
> - **A current value** (`score`) that starts at `0`
> - **A setter function** (`setScore`) that can be used to update the value and trigger a re-render

### Step 2: Share score with all components

**File:** `src/context/GameContext.jsx`

Make score available to all components by adding it to the Context value object.

```javascript
export function GameProvider({ children }) {
  // ... state declarations ...
  
  return (
    <GameContext
      value={{
        // GAME STATE
        screen,
        score,  // Add score to value
        zoneProgress,
        // ... rest of properties
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </GameContext>
  );
}
```

> üí° **Understanding How State Is Shared**
>
> In Step 1, you created `score` as local state.
>
> By adding it to the Context value here, you make it available across your app.
>
> Now any component that calls `useGame()` can access `score` ‚Äî no prop-drilling needed.

### Step 3: Create Scoreboard component

**File:** `src/components/HUD.jsx`

Create a new component that displays the score from shared state.

```javascript
// Add import at top of file:
import { useGame } from "../hooks/useGame";  // [1] Import useGame hook

// Add after imports:
function Scoreboard() {
  const { score } = useGame();  // [2] Get score from shared state
  return <div className="score-display">Score: {score}</div>;  // [3] Display score
}
```

> üí° **Understanding Shared State Access**
>
> 1. **Import useGame hook**: Access the shared game state from Context
> 2. **Get score from shared state**: Destructure the score value from GameContext
> 3. **Display score**: Render the score in a styled div
>
> The Scoreboard component accesses the score directly from shared state using the `useGame` hook. This means any component can display or use the score without passing it through props. When the score updates in GameContext, all components using it automatically re-render with the new value.

### Step 4: Add Scoreboard to HUD

**File:** `src/components/HUD.jsx`

Update the HUD component to render both Scoreboard and CurrentZone using a React Fragment.

```javascript
// Before:
export default function HUD() {
  return <CurrentZone />;
}

// After:
export default function HUD() {
  return (
    <>
      <Scoreboard />
      <CurrentZone />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Step 5: Test score display

Navigate to the game screen.

**‚úì You should see:** "Score: 0" appears in the HUD above the current zone display.

<a id="implementing-score-updates"></a>

## üìä Implementing Score Updates

üéØ **Goal:** Make the score change based on player performance with point rewards and penalties.

**File:** `src/context/GameContext.jsx`

You'll update the `recordCorrectAnswer` and `recordIncorrectAnswer` functions to modify the score when players answer questions.

### Step 1: Add points for correct answers

Update the `recordCorrectAnswer` function to award points when players answer correctly.

```javascript
const recordCorrectAnswer = () => {
  setCorrectAnswers((prev) => prev + 1);
  setScore((prev) => prev + POINTS_PER_CORRECT);  // Add points
};
```

> üí° **Understanding Updater Functions**
>
> `setScore((prev) => prev + POINTS_PER_CORRECT)` uses an **updater function** ‚Äî a way to update state based on what it was before.
>
> Instead of giving React a new value directly, you give it a function. That function gets the current value (`prev`) and returns the updated one. This is super useful when the new value depends on the old one ‚Äî like adding points to a score.

### Step 2: Add point deduction for incorrect answers

Update the `recordIncorrectAnswer` function to deduct points, preventing negative scores.

```javascript
const recordIncorrectAnswer = () => {
  setScore((prev) => Math.max(0, prev - POINTS_PER_CORRECT));  // Deduct points
};
```

> üí° **Understanding Math.max for Score Boundaries**
>
> `Math.max(0, prev - POINTS_PER_CORRECT)` keeps the score from dropping below zero. It compares the result of the subtraction with `0` and returns whichever is higher.
>
> That way, if the player doesn't have enough points to lose, their score just stays at zero.

### Step 3: Reset score on game reset

Update the `resetGame` function to reset the score back to zero when players start over.

```javascript
const resetGame = () => {
  setScore(0);  // Reset score to zero
  setZoneProgress({
    0: { completed: false },
    1: { completed: false },
    2: { completed: false },
  });
  setIsQuizVisible(false);
  setCurrentQuestions([]);
  setCurrentQuestion(0);
  setCorrectAnswers(0);
};
```

### Step 4: Test score updates

Click a zone, then answer questions.

**‚úì You should see:**

- Score starts at 0 when game begins
- Correct answer ‚Üí Score increases by 100 points
- Incorrect answer ‚Üí Score decreases by 100 points (but never below 0)

<a id="adding-cache-clearing"></a>

## üóÑÔ∏è Adding Cache Clearing

üéØ **Goal:** Add cache clearing functions to remove stored questions when zones are completed or the game resets.

You'll build two helper functions ‚Äî one to clear a single zone's cache, and one to clear all cached questions ‚Äî then use them when zones are completed and when the game resets.

### Step 1: Create cache clearing functions

**File:** `src/services/trivia.js`

Add the cache clearing functions at the end of the file.

```javascript
// Add clearQuestionCache function:
export function clearQuestionCache(zoneId) {
  const key = getCacheKey(zoneId);             // [1] Get cache key
  localStorage.removeItem(key);                // [2] Remove from storage
}

// Add clearAllQuestionCache function:
export function clearAllQuestionCache() {
  Object.keys(localStorage)                                    // [3] Get all keys
    .filter((key) => key.startsWith("trivia_questions_zone_")) // [4] Filter keys
    .forEach((key) => localStorage.removeItem(key));           // [5] Remove each
}
```

> üí° **Understanding Cache Clearing**
>
> 1. **Get cache key**: Use `getCacheKey()` to create the correct key for this zone
> 2. **Remove from storage**: Delete the cache entry using `localStorage.removeItem()`
> 3. **Get all keys**: `Object.keys(localStorage)` returns array of all localStorage keys
> 4. **Filter keys**: Keep only keys starting with `"trivia_questions_zone_"`
> 5. **Remove each**: Delete each matching cache entry
>
> The `clearAllQuestionCache` function uses method chaining to find and remove all trivia-related cache entries without affecting other localStorage data your app might use.

### Step 2: Import cache functions into GameContext

**File:** `src/context/GameContext.jsx`

Update your import to include the cache clearing functions.

```javascript
// Before:
import { fetchQuestions } from "../services/trivia";

// After:
import { 
  fetchQuestions, 
  clearQuestionCache, 
  clearAllQuestionCache 
} from "../services/trivia";
```

### Step 3: Clear cache on zone completion

**File:** `src/context/GameContext.jsx`

Update the `checkZoneCompletion` function to clear the zone's cache when players pass, ensuring fresh questions if they replay.

```javascript
const checkZoneCompletion = () => {
  // ... existing validation and calculation logic ...

  if (passed) {
    setZoneProgress((prev) => ({
      ...prev,
      [activeZone]: { completed: true },
    }));
    
    clearQuestionCache(activeZone);  // Clear completed zone cache

    if (activeZone === ZONES.length - 1) {
      setScreen(SCREENS.GAME_OVER);
    }
  }
};
```

> üí° **Understanding Cache Clearing on Completion**
>
> When players complete a zone, clearing its cache ensures they get fresh questions if they replay. Without this, replaying would show the exact same questions they just answered, reducing the challenge and interest.

### Step 4: Clear cache on game reset

**File:** `src/context/GameContext.jsx`

Update the `resetGame` function to clear all cached questions when players start over.

```javascript
const resetGame = () => {
  setScore(0);
  setZoneProgress({
    0: { completed: false },
    1: { completed: false },
    2: { completed: false },
  });
  setIsQuizVisible(false);
  setCurrentQuestions([]);
  setCurrentQuestion(0);
  setCorrectAnswers(0);
  clearAllQuestionCache();  // Clear all cached questions
};
```

> üí° **Understanding Cache Clearing on Reset**
>
> Clearing all cached questions on game reset ensures players get fresh questions for every zone when they start a new game. This prevents stale data from previous games and provides a clean slate for new gameplay sessions.

### Step 5: Test cache clearing

Test both zone completion and game reset cache clearing.

**Test zone completion:**

- **Open** DevTools (`F12`) ‚Üí Application/Storage tab ‚Üí Local Storage
- **Complete** a zone by answering enough questions correctly
- **Observe** the localStorage panel

**‚úì You should see:** The cache entry for the completed zone is removed from localStorage.

**Test game reset:**

- **Open** React DevTools ‚Üí Components tab ‚Üí Find `GameProvider`
- **Scroll** to hooks section ‚Üí Find `resetGame` function
- **Click** the function icon to execute it
- **Check** localStorage panel in Application/Storage tab

**‚úì You should see:** All cache entries are removed from localStorage.

## üéñÔ∏è Solo Mission: GameOver Component

You've built components with guidance ‚Äî now it's your turn to create a victory screen using the patterns you've practiced.

### What You're Building

A final screen that appears when the player completes all zones. It should display a congratulations message, show the final score, and offer a way to play again.

---

### Phase 1: Component Foundation

üéØ **Goal:** Set up the basic structure of your GameOver component

**Your Tasks:**

1. Create a new file: `src/components/GameOver.jsx`
2. Define a React component and export it as the default
3. In the component's return, include a div with `className="game-over"` that contains an h1 congratulating the player
4. In `App.jsx`, import your new GameOver component
5. Add a condition in `App.jsx` to render GameOver when `screen === SCREENS.GAME_OVER`

**Test:** Use React DevTools to manually set `screen` to `"gameover"` ‚Äî the component should appear in the browser

---

### Phase 2: Score Display

üéØ **Goal:** Show the player's final score on the GameOver screen

**Your Tasks:**

1. Import the `useGame` hook at the top of `GameOver.jsx` from `"../hooks/useGame"`
2. Inside the component, use the hook and destructure `score`:
   ```javascript
   const { score } = useGame();
   ```
3. Below the congratulations h1, display the score in a div with `className="final-score"` using `{score}`

**Test:** Play the game to build up a score, then use React DevTools to set `screen` to `"gameover"` (like in Phase 1) to quickly view the score display

---

### Phase 3: Play Again Button

üéØ **Goal:** Let players restart the game from the GameOver screen

**Your Tasks:**

1. Add imports:
   - Import `SCREENS` from `"../constants/screens"`
   - Import `GameButton` from `"./GameButton"`
2. Inside the component, get `resetGame` and `setScreen` from `useGame()`
3. Write a click handler that resets the game and shows the splash screen:
   ```javascript
   const playAgain = () => {
     resetGame();
     setScreen(SCREENS.SPLASH);
   };
   ```
4. Below the final-score div, render the button with:
   - Text: "Play Again"
   - Variant: `"primary"`
   - Your click handler

**Test:** Use React DevTools to set `screen` to `"gameover"` (like in Phase 1), then click the button ‚Üí returns to splash ‚Üí score and zones reset

---

### ‚úÖ Success Review

Your GameOver component should:

- Appear when the game ends
- Show a congratulations message
- Display the final score using `useGame()`
- Include a working "Play Again" button
- Support multiple full game cycles without issues
