## Slide Deck Outline

### **Slide 1: Custom Hooks & Browser APIs üéµ**

- **Title:** "Session 9: Custom Hooks & Browser APIs ‚Äî Adding Theme Music"
- **Session 8 Recap:** "Last time: You implemented scoring and victory with complex state management"
- **Hook:** "Your game tracks progress ‚Äî now let's make it sound amazing!"
- **Today's Mission:** Build custom audio hooks with browser API integration and AI-assisted development
- **Visual:** Audio waveform with React hook icons
- **Connection:** "From interactive components to immersive audio experiences!"

### **Slide 2: Custom Hooks ü™ù**

- **Teaching Focus:** Why custom hooks make coding easier and more fun
- **Key Concepts:** 
  - **Custom hooks** as functions starting with "use" that extract component logic
  - **DRY principle** - "Don't Repeat Yourself" through reusable solutions
  - **"Write once, use often"** approach to eliminate code duplication
- **Built-in vs Custom Hooks Comparison:**
  - Built-in: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef` (provided by React)
  - Custom: `useGame`, `useAudio` (created by developers)
- **Discussion Questions:**
  - "What happens when you copy audio logic into every component?"
  - "How do custom hooks solve code duplication?"
- **Real-World Context:** Show examples from popular React libraries
- **Student Preparation:** "You'll create useAudio to bundle all audio complexity"

### **Slide 3: Browser APIs üîä**

- **Teaching Focus:** A perfect example of what custom hook use case, i.e., adding audio functionality to a web-based game
- **Key Concepts:**
  - **HTMLAudioElement** as browser's built-in interface for audio control
  - **Programmatic control** through JavaScript vs HTML audio tags
  - **Core methods:** `play()`, `pause()`, volume, loop properties
  - **Promise-based play()** method for error handling
- **Demonstration:** Live audio control with HTMLAudioElement
- **Hook Use Case:** "HTMLAudioElement is exactly what useAudio will wrap in a reusable way"
- **Common Misconceptions:** Address when students think they need external audio libraries
- **Preview:** "Next: How do we store browser objects in React components?"

### **Slide 4: Refs and State üîó**

- **Teaching Focus:** Decision-making criteria for data storage
- **Key Concepts:**
  - **State:** Triggers re-renders, for UI-affecting data, accessed with `value`
  - **Refs:** No re-renders, for non-UI data, accessed with `ref.current`
  - **Refs as bookmarks** that remember information without affecting rendering
- **Interactive Exercise:** Students categorize different data types
- **Key Question:** "Does changing this data affect what users see?"
- **Audio Example:** Audio object (ref) vs playback state (state)
- **Key Skill:** "This decision-making process applies to all React development"

### **Slide 5: useRef Hook üìç**

- **Teaching Focus:** Resource management strategies and common useRef patterns
- **Key Concepts:**
  - **useRef mechanics:** Container for mutable data, persistent across updates
  - **Access via current:** `ref.current` holds the actual value
  - **Mutable data** that can be changed without triggering re-renders
  - **Lazy initialization:** Creating resources only when first needed
- **Common useRef Patterns:**
  - **Storing Mutable Values (Audio Use Case):** `audioRef.current = new Audio(src)` - bookmark pattern for browser objects
  - **Accessing DOM Elements:** `inputRef.current.focus()` - direct connection to HTML elements
  - **Key Pattern:** `if (!ref.current)` for lazy initialization and null checks
- **Audio Example Walkthrough:**
  ```javascript
  const audioRef = useRef(null); // Bookmark starts empty
  if (!audioRef.current) {       // Check if audio exists
    audioRef.current = new Audio(src); // Create and bookmark
  }
  audioRef.current.play();       // Use bookmarked audio
  ```
- **Performance Discussion:** Why create resources only when needed?
- **Memory Management:** How refs persist across re-renders without causing them
- **Student Application:** "You'll use both patterns - mutable values for audio storage and the bookmark concept for persistent references"

### **Slide 6: Component Integration üéõÔ∏è**

- **Teaching Focus:** Development workflow
- **Key Concepts:**
  - **Conditional rendering** with dynamic images and tooltips
  - **State-driven UI** where appearance changes based on data
  - **Visual feedback** through different icons for play/pause states
- **Strategy:** Build testing interface before functionality
- **Benefits:** Immediate visual feedback during development
- **Student Guidance:** "MusicToggle gives you a way to test useAudio as you build it"
- **Key Strategy:** "This is how developers build complex features step by step"

### **Slide 7: Audio Reference üìª**
