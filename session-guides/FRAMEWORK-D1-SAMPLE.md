## üîÑ Transforming API Data

The API returns data in its own format, but your game needs a different structure. You'll build the transformation incrementally, testing after each step to see your progress.

### Step 1: Set Up Transformation Testing

Before building the transformation, add logging to see the before and after.

- **Add** after the validation check in fetchQuestions:
  ```javascript
  const firstQuestion = data.results[0];
  console.log("Before transform:", firstQuestion);
  
  const transformed = transformQuestion(firstQuestion);
  console.log("After transform:", transformed);
  ```

- **Verify:** Click a zone and check the console. You'll see `undefined` because transformQuestion isn't implemented yet.

### Step 2: Extract the Raw Properties

Pull out the question and answers from the API response.

- **Add** in the transformQuestion function:
  ```javascript
  function transformQuestion(apiQuestion) {
    const question = apiQuestion.question;
    const incorrectAnswers = apiQuestion.incorrect_answers;
    const correctAnswer = apiQuestion.correct_answer;
    
    console.log("Extracted properties:", { question, incorrectAnswers, correctAnswer });
  }
  ```

- **Verify:** Click a zone. You should see the raw extracted data in the console.

### Step 3: Decode the URL Encoding

Convert the encoded text (`What%20does%20GHz%20stand%20for%3F`) into readable format.

- **Update** transformQuestion to use the helper function:
  ```javascript
  function transformQuestion(apiQuestion) {
    const question = decodeText(apiQuestion.question);
    const incorrectAnswers = apiQuestion.incorrect_answers.map(answer => decodeText(answer));
    const correctAnswer = decodeText(apiQuestion.correct_answer);
    
    console.log("Decoded data:", { question, incorrectAnswers, correctAnswer });
  }
  ```

- **Expected output:**
  ```javascript
  {
    "question": "What does GHz stand for?",
    "incorrectAnswers": ["Gigahotz", "Gigahetz", "Gigahatz"],
    "correctAnswer": "Gigahertz"
  }
  ```

> **üí° Concept:** The `map()` method transforms each item in an array. Here, it decodes each incorrect answer.

### Step 4: Shuffle Answers and Find the Correct Index

Randomize answer order so players can't memorize positions.

- **Add** the shuffling logic:
  ```javascript
  function transformQuestion(apiQuestion) {
    const question = decodeText(apiQuestion.question);
    const incorrectAnswers = apiQuestion.incorrect_answers.map(answer => decodeText(answer));
    const correctAnswer = decodeText(apiQuestion.correct_answer);
    const shuffledAnswers = shuffleAnswers(correctAnswer, incorrectAnswers);
    const correctIndex = shuffledAnswers.indexOf(correctAnswer);
    
    console.log("Shuffled answers:", shuffledAnswers);
    console.log("Correct answer is at index:", correctIndex);
  }
  ```

- **Verify:** You should see shuffled answers and the index where the correct answer ended up.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** Don't modify the original arrays. The helper functions return new arrays to avoid side effects.

### Step 5: Return the Game Object

Build the final format your game needs.

- **Add** the return statement:
  ```javascript
  function transformQuestion(apiQuestion) {
    const question = decodeText(apiQuestion.question);
    const incorrectAnswers = apiQuestion.incorrect_answers.map(answer => decodeText(answer));
    const correctAnswer = decodeText(apiQuestion.correct_answer);
    const shuffledAnswers = shuffleAnswers(correctAnswer, incorrectAnswers);
    const correctIndex = shuffledAnswers.indexOf(correctAnswer);

    return {
      question: question,
      answers: shuffledAnswers,
      correct: correctIndex
    };
  }
  ```

- **Expected output:**
  ```javascript
  {
    "question": "What does CPU stand for?",
    "answers": [
      "Central Process Unit",
      "Computer Personal Unit", 
      "Central Processing Unit",
      "Central Processor Unit"
    ],
    "correct": 2
  }
  ```

### Step 6: Apply to All Questions

Now use your transformation function to process the entire array.

- **Replace** the test logging in fetchQuestions:
  ```javascript
  const questions = data.results.map(apiQuestion => transformQuestion(apiQuestion));
  console.log("All transformed questions:", questions);
  return questions;
  ```

- **Verify the complete implementation:**
  1. Click a zone
  2. Open React DevTools (F12)
  3. Navigate to Components tab
  4. Find GameProvider
  5. Check currentQuestions state
  6. Confirm it contains an array of properly formatted questions

> **‚úÖ Success Check:**
> - [ ] Questions array appears in GameProvider state
> - [ ] Each question has `question`, `answers`, and `correct` properties
> - [ ] Answers are shuffled (different order each time)
> - [ ] No console errors

Data transformation is core to web development. APIs rarely return data in your exact format, so you build functions that bridge the gap.

## üèÜ Adding Score Tracking

Your game needs to track player performance and display it prominently.

### Step 1: Add Score State

Create state to track the player's current score.

- **Open** `src/context/GameContext.jsx` and add inside GameProvider:
  ```javascript
  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);
  ```

- **Add** to the Context value:
  ```javascript
  <GameContext.Provider value={{
    // GAME STATE
    screen,
    score,
    zoneProgress,
    // ... rest of existing properties
  ```

- **Verify:** Open React DevTools ‚Üí GameProvider ‚Üí hooks ‚Üí score should be 0

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è Note:** State initialized to 0 ensures the game starts with a clean slate.

### Step 2: Display Score in HUD

Show the score to players during gameplay.

- **Open** `src/components/HUD.jsx` and add at the top:
  ```javascript
  function Scoreboard() {
    const { score } = useGame();
    return <div className="score-display">Score: {score}</div>;
  }
  ```

- **Update** HUD component to render both components:
  ```javascript
  return (
    <>
      <Scoreboard />
      <CurrentZone />
    </>
  );
  ```

- **Verify:** Navigate to game screen. "Score: 0" should appear in the HUD.

> **üéØ Pro Tip:** Use React DevTools to change the score value and watch the UI update in real-time.

### Step 3: Update Score on Correct Answers

Reward players with points for correct answers.

- **Find** the `recordCorrectAnswer` function in GameContext.jsx
- **Add** point reward:
  ```javascript
  const recordCorrectAnswer = () => {
    setCorrectAnswers((prev) => prev + 1);
    setScore((prev) => prev + POINTS_PER_CORRECT);
  };
  ```

- **Verify:** Answer questions correctly. Score should increase by 100 points each time.

> **üí° Concept:** Updater functions like `setScore((prev) => prev + 100)` ensure accurate calculations even when React batches multiple state updates.

## Verification Pattern Examples

### Pattern A: Inline Verification (Simple)

- **Update** the title:
  ```html
  <title>Wizcamp Realms - Legends of Trivia</title>
  ```
  **Verify:** Browser tab should display the new title

### Pattern B: Bullet Verification (Standard)

- **Update** the title:
  ```html
  <title>Wizcamp Realms - Legends of Trivia</title>
  ```

- **Verify:** Check the browser tab. It should display "Wizcamp Realms - Legends of Trivia"

### Pattern C: Dedicated Verification Section (Complex)

- **Update** the scoring system

- **Verify the implementation:**
  1. Start the game
  2. Answer a question correctly
  3. Check that score increases by 10
  4. Answer incorrectly
  5. Verify score doesn't go below 0

### Pattern D: Expected Output Block (API/Data)

- **Fetch** questions from the API:
  ```javascript
  const response = await fetch(url);
  const data = await response.json();
  ```

- **Expected output:**
  ```javascript
  {
    "response_code": 0,
    "results": [
      {
        "question": "What does CPU stand for?",
        "correct_answer": "Central Processing Unit"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

### Pattern E: Success Criteria Callout (Checklist)

- **Complete** the scoring system implementation

> **‚úÖ Success Check:**
> - [ ] Score displays "0" when game starts
> - [ ] Score increases by 10 for correct answers
> - [ ] Score decreases by 10 for incorrect answers (minimum 0)
> - [ ] Score resets to 0 when "Play Again" is clicked
