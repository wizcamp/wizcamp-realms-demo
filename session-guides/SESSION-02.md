## 🧩 Create Your First Component

Let's build a GameButton component for starting your trivia game. Components are like digital LEGO blocks — custom, reusable UI elements.

When you create a component, export it with `export default` so it can be shared across your project. Then bring it into other files with `import`.

1. **Create the file**: Right-click `src/components` → New File → name it `GameButton.jsx`
2. **Type the component structure**:
   ```javascript
   export default function GameButton() {
     return <button>Start Adventure</button>;
   }
   ```

3. **Import into SplashScreen**: Add `import GameButton from "./GameButton"` at the top

4. **Add your button**: Place your button within `div.splash-buttons`:
   ```javascript
   <GameButton />
   ```
5. **Test it**: Run `npm run dev` and you should see your custom button!

### 💡 Why This Matters

**Components** are the heart of React — reusable UI elements that combine markup, styling, and logic. Think of them as your own custom HTML tags. The `.jsx` file extension means you're writing **JSX**, a special syntax that looks like HTML but is actually JavaScript. JSX lets you describe what the UI should look like using readable, expressive code.

### 🏆 Bonus Challenge

## 📦 Understanding Props

Props are how you pass data from parent components to child components. They're like function parameters but for React components.

1. **Add text prop to GameButton**:

   ```javascript
   export default function GameButton({ text }) {
     return <button>{text}</button>;
   }
   ```

2. **Update SplashScreen to pass text**:

   ```javascript
   <GameButton text="Start Adventure" />
   ```

3. **Watch the magic**: Your button now shows custom text!

### 💡 Why This Matters

**Props** let parent components pass data to child components — just like function parameters. This makes your components flexible and reusable. The `{ text }` syntax is called **destructuring** — it pulls out just the values you need from the props object, keeping your code clean and readable.

## 🖱️ Adding Click Functionality

Let's make your buttons actually do something when clicked. In React, you can pass functions as props just like any other data.

1. **Add onClick prop to GameButton**:

   ```javascript
   export default function GameButton({ text, onClick }) {
     return <button onClick={onClick}>{text}</button>;
   }
   ```

2. **Update SplashScreen with click handler**:

   ```javascript
   <GameButton
     text="Start Adventure"
     onClick={() => alert('Start Game!')}
   />
   ```

3. **Test it**: Click your button and see the alert!

### 💡 Why This Matters

**Functions as props** are like giving your components different personalities. Your GameButton can do different things depending on where you use it — same button, different actions. It's a key pattern in React for building interactive apps.

## 🎨 Styling with Variants

Let's add visual variety to your buttons using CSS classes, default parameters, and a clean variable approach.

1. **Add variant prop with default value and create buttonClass variable**:

   ```javascript
   export default function GameButton({ text, onClick, variant = "primary" }) {
     const buttonClass = `game-button ${variant}`;

     return (
       <button className={buttonClass} onClick={onClick}>
         {text}
       </button>
     );
   }
   ```

2. **Update SplashScreen with variant**:

   ```javascript
   <GameButton
     text="Start Adventure"
     onClick={() => alert('Start Game!')}
     variant="primary"
   />
   ```

3. **Admire your styled button**: Your button now has the primary styling!

### 💡 Why This Matters

**className** is React's version of the HTML `class` attribute. We use a **template literal** to build a dynamic class name like `game-button primary`. This matches the styles already defined in your project. The `variant` prop lets you switch between styles like `primary` and `secondary`, and **default parameters** like `variant = "primary"` ensure your component still works even if no variant is passed.

## 🔄 Reusing Your Component

Now that you've built a complete, fully-featured GameButton component, let's experience the power of reusability by adding a second button for the game's credits.

1. **Add a second button**: Below your existing GameButton in SplashScreen, add one that will show credits when clicked:
   ```javascript
   <GameButton
     text="Credits"
     onClick={() => alert('Show Credits')}
     variant="secondary"
   />
   ```
2. **Admire your work**: You now have two different buttons using the same component!

### 💡 Why This Matters

**Component reusability** is React's superpower. You wrote the GameButton code once, but now you can use it anywhere in your app with different props. Thanks to your stylesheet, each variant (`primary`, `secondary`) automatically applies the right look — no extra styling needed.

### 🏆 Bonus Challenge

Try adding a third GameButton with `variant="primary"` and `text="Instructions"` to see how easy it is to scale your UI!

## 🔍 Install React DevTools

React DevTools is like X-ray vision for your React app — see component structure, props, and state in real-time.

### Using DevTools

1. **Open DevTools**: Press F12 or right-click → Inspect
2. **Find Components tab**: Look for "Components" next to Console, Network, etc.
3. **Explore your app**: Click on components in the tree to see their props
4. **Inspect GameButton**: Find your GameButton component and see the text, onClick, and variant props!

### 💡 Why This Matters

**React DevTools** gives you X-ray vision into your app. You can inspect components, props, and state in real time — just like a pro. It's one of the most important tools for debugging and understanding how your app works under the hood.

## 📚 Essential Terms

_Quick reference for all the React concepts you just learned:_

| Term                      | Definition                                                                                       | Why it matters                                                                                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧩 component          | A reusable piece of UI that can include markup, styles, and logic (example: `<SplashScreen />`). | You'll build your entire app by composing components together — they're React's building blocks.      |
| 📦 props              | Data passed from parent to child components.       | Props let you customize components and pass data around your app — essential for reusable components. |
| ✨ JSX                | JavaScript syntax that looks like HTML — used to describe UI in React components (`.jsx`).       | You'll write JSX in your GameButton component to describe what the button should look like.                      |
| 🎨 className          | React's version of the HTML `class` attribute for applying CSS styles.                           | Use className instead of class because class is a reserved word in JavaScript.                        |
| 📤 destructuring      | Extracting values from objects/arrays into variables, like `{ text, onClick }` from props.       | Makes your code cleaner by avoiding repetitive `props.text`, `props.onClick` syntax.                  |
| 🔤 template literals  | String interpolation using backticks and `${}` for dynamic strings.                              | Perfect for creating dynamic CSS classes like `` `game-button ${variant}` ``.                  |
| ⚙️ default parameters | Fallback values for function parameters, like `variant = "primary"`.                             | Ensures your components work even when some props aren't provided.                                    |
| 🔍 React DevTools     | Browser extension for inspecting React component trees, props, and state.                        | Essential debugging tool — like X-ray vision for your React app.                                      |
