## üí° Understanding React's Approach

Why did swapping `<StartHere />` for `<SplashScreen />` feel so effortless? It's all about React's approach to building UIs.

With vanilla JavaScript, you write lots of repetitive code to update the page. React works differently: you build self-contained components, and React handles all the messy details of getting them on screen and keeping them updated.

*Figure: Vanilla JavaScript vs React ‚Äî Why Components Make Development Easier*

That's why swapping components felt so smooth. You weren't just editing code‚Äîyou were shaping the UI with reusable building blocks.

Now let's build your first custom component and see that power in action.

<a id="creating-your-first-component"></a>

## üß© Creating Your First Component

Let's build a `GameButton` component for starting your trivia game. Components are like digital LEGO blocks ‚Äî custom, reusable UI elements.

When you create a component, export it with `export default` so it can be shared across your project. Then bring it into other files with `import`.

1. **Create** the file by right-clicking `src/components` ‚Üí New File ‚Üí name it `GameButton.jsx`
2. **Type** the component structure
   ```javascript
   export default function GameButton() {
     return <button>Start Adventure</button>;
   }
   ```

3. **Import** into SplashScreen by adding `import GameButton from "./GameButton";` at the top

4. **Add** your button within `div.splash-buttons`
   ```javascript
   <GameButton />
   ```
5. **Test** by running `npm run dev` and you should see your custom button!



**Components** are the heart of React ‚Äî reusable UI elements that combine markup, styling, and logic. Think of them as your own custom HTML tags. The `.jsx` file extension means you're writing **JSX**, a special syntax that looks like HTML but is actually JavaScript. JSX lets you describe what the UI should look like using readable, expressive code.

### üèÜ Bonus Challenge

Try changing the button text in GameButton.jsx and watch it update instantly thanks to Hot Module Replacement!

<a id="understanding-props"></a>

## üì¶ Understanding Props

Props are how you pass data from parent components to child components. They're like function parameters but for React components.

1. **Add** `text` prop to `GameButton`

   ```javascript
   export default function GameButton({ text }) {
     return <button>{text}</button>;
   }
   ```

2. **Update** SplashScreen to pass the `text` prop to `GameButton`

   ```javascript
   <GameButton text="Start Adventure" />
   ```

3. **Watch** the magic as your button now shows custom text!



**Props** let parent components pass data to child components ‚Äî just like function parameters. This makes your components flexible and reusable. The `{ text }` syntax is called **destructuring** ‚Äî it pulls out just the values you need from the props object, keeping your code clean and readable.

## üñ±Ô∏è Adding Click Functionality

Let's make your buttons actually do something when clicked. In React, you can pass functions as props just like any other data.

1. **Add** `onClick` prop to `GameButton`

   ```javascript
   export default function GameButton({ text, onClick }) {
     return <button onClick={onClick}>{text}</button>;
   }
   ```

2. **Update** `SplashScreen` to add click handler to `GameButton`

   ```javascript
   <GameButton
     text="Start Adventure"
     onClick={() => alert('Start Game!')}
   />
   ```

3. **Test** by clicking your button and see the alert!



**Functions as props** are like giving your components different personalities. Your `GameButton` can do different things depending on where you use it ‚Äî same button, different actions. It's a key pattern in React for building interactive apps.

<a id="styling-with-variants"></a>

## üé® Styling with Variants

Let's add visual variety to your buttons using CSS classes, default parameters, and a clean variable approach.

1. **Add** `variant` prop, **create** `buttonClass` variable, and **include** in JSX

   ```javascript
   export default function GameButton({ text, onClick, variant = "primary" }) {
     const buttonClass = `game-button ${variant}`;

     return (
       <button className={buttonClass} onClick={onClick}>
         {text}
       </button>
     );
   }
   ```

2. **Update** `SplashScreen` to add `variant` prop to `GameButton`

   ```javascript
   <GameButton
     text="Start Adventure"
     onClick={() => alert('Start Game!')}
     variant="primary"
   />
   ```

3. **Admire** your styled button as it now has the primary styling!



**`className`** is React's version of the HTML `class` attribute. We use a **template literal** to build a dynamic class name like `game-button primary`. This matches the styles already defined in your project. The `variant` prop lets you switch between styles like `primary` and `secondary`, and **default parameters** like `variant = "primary"` ensure your component still works even if no variant is passed.

## üîÑ Reusing Your Component

Now that you've built a complete, fully-featured GameButton component, let's experience the power of reusability by adding a second button for the game's credits.

1. **Add** a Credits button below your existing GameButton
   ```javascript
   <GameButton
     text="Credits"
     onClick={() => alert('Show Credits')}
     variant="secondary"
   />
   ```
2. **Admire** your work as you now have two different buttons using the same component!



**Component reusability** is React's superpower. You wrote the `GameButton` code once, but now you can use it anywhere in your app with different props. Thanks to your stylesheet, each variant (`primary`, `secondary`) automatically applies the right look ‚Äî no extra styling needed.

### üèÜ Bonus Challenge

Try adding a third GameButton with `variant="primary"` and `text="Instructions"` to see how easy it is to scale your UI!

## üîç Installing React DevTools

React DevTools is like X-ray vision for your React app ‚Äî see component structure, props, and state in real-time.

### Browser Installation

| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| **Chrome**  | [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)     | Most popular choice |
| **Firefox** | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/)                                        | Great alternative   |

### Using DevTools

1. **Open** DevTools by pressing F12 or right-clicking ‚Üí Inspect
2. **Find** Components tab by looking for "Components" next to Console, Network, etc.
3. **Explore** your app by clicking on components in the tree to see their props
4. **Inspect** GameButton by finding your GameButton component and see the text, onClick, and variant props!



**React DevTools** gives you X-ray vision into your app. You can inspect components, props, and state in real time ‚Äî essential for debugging and understanding how your app works under the hood.

## üìö Essential Terms

_Quick reference for all the React concepts you just learned:_

| Term   | Definition | Why it matters |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| üß© component | A reusable piece of UI that can include markup, styles, and logic (example: `<SplashScreen />`). | You'll build your entire app by composing components together ‚Äî they're React's building blocks. |
| üì¶ props | Data passed from parent to child components. | Props let you customize components and pass data around your app ‚Äî essential for reusable components. |
| ‚ú® JSX | JavaScript syntax that looks like HTML ‚Äî used to describe UI in React components (`.jsx`). | You'll write JSX in your `GameButton` component to describe what the button should look like. |
| üé® className | React's version of the HTML `class` attribute for applying CSS styles. | Use `className` instead of `class` because `class` is a reserved word in JavaScript. |
| üì§ destructuring | Extracting values from objects/arrays into variables, like `{ text, onClick }` from props. | Makes your code cleaner by avoiding repetitive `props.text`, `props.onClick` syntax. |
| üî§ template literals | String interpolation using backticks and `${}` for dynamic strings. | Perfect for creating dynamic CSS classes like `` `game-button ${variant}` ``. |
| ‚öôÔ∏è default parameters | Fallback values for function parameters, like `variant = "primary"`. | Ensures your components work even when some props aren't provided. |
| üîç React DevTools | Browser extension for inspecting React component trees, props, and state. | Essential debugging tool ‚Äî like X-ray vision for your React app. |
