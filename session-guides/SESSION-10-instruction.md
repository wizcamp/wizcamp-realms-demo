```

- **Key Commands and Staging Concept:**
  - **`git add .`** - Stage all changes for commit
    - **Staging Area Purpose:** Acts as a "preparation area" between your working files and permanent commits
    - **Why Staging Exists:** Lets you choose exactly which changes to include in each commit
    - **Conceptual Flow:** Working Directory ‚Üí Staging Area ‚Üí Local Repository ‚Üí Remote Repository
  - **`git commit -m "message"`** - Create snapshot with description
  - **`git push`** - Upload commits to remote repository
- **Conventional Commits Pattern:** Students learn the structured format `type(scope): description`
  - **Type examples:** `feat` (new feature), `fix` (bug fix), `style` (visual changes), `docs` (documentation)
  - **Scope examples:** `(quiz)`, `(scoring)`, `(logo)` - indicates what part of the app changed
  - **Description:** Clear, concise explanation of what the commit does
  - **Example:** `feat(logo): customize game title to Trivia Quest`
- **Why This Structure Matters:**
  - **Searchable history** - Easy to find specific types of changes
  - **Automated tools** - Many tools parse this format for release notes
  - **Team communication** - Consistent format improves collaboration
- **Student Application:** "This workflow becomes automatic with practice"

### **Slide 4: Repository Ownership - Making It Yours üè†**

- **Teaching Focus:** Transitioning from starter template to personal project
- **Local vs Remote Repository Architecture:**
  - **Local Repository:** Lives on student's computer (Codespace), contains full project history
  - **Remote Repository:** Lives on GitHub servers, serves as backup and collaboration hub
  - **Relationship:** Local and remote repositories sync via push/pull operations
  - **Data Flow:** Changes start local, get pushed to remote, others can pull from remote
- **The Challenge:** Students start with Wizcamp's repository but need their own for deployment
- **Key Steps:**
  1. **Disconnect** from starter repo (`git remote remove origin`)
  2. **Create** new GitHub repository (public for free Pages hosting)
  3. **Connect** to personal repo (`git remote add origin`)
  4. **Verify** connection (`git remote -v`)
- **Important Notes:**
  - **Don't initialize** new repo with README (project already has one)
  - **Keep public** for free GitHub Pages hosting
  - **Choose meaningful names** like "trivia-quest" or "wizcamp-game"
- **Repository Ownership Impact:** Students transition from using someone else's remote repository to owning their complete local/remote repository pair
- **Empowerment:** "This makes the project truly yours to control and share"

### **Slide 5: CI/CD - Automation That Changes Everything ‚öôÔ∏è**

- **Teaching Focus:** How automation transforms development workflows

  2. **Run build command** - Vite bundles React app for production
  3. **Optimize assets** - Compress images, minify code
  4. **Deploy files** - Upload to GitHub Pages hosting
- **Monitoring Builds:**
  - **Actions tab** shows workflow runs and status
  - **Green checkmarks** indicate successful deployments
  - **Red X marks** show failed builds with error details
- **Student Guidance:** "You'll watch your first deployment happen in real-time"

### **Slide 7: GitHub Pages - Free Hosting for Your Projects üåê**

- **Teaching Focus:** Understanding static site hosting and configuration
- **Key Concepts:**
  - **Static site hosting** - Serves HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
  - **Perfect for React apps** - Built React apps are static files
  - **Free tier** - Unlimited public repositories get free hosting
  - **Custom domains** - Can use your own domain name (advanced)
- **Configuration Steps:**
  - **Repository Settings** ‚Üí **Pages** section
  - **Source: GitHub Actions** (not legacy branch-based deployment)
  - **Automatic SSL** - HTTPS enabled by default
- **URL Structure:** `https://username.github.io/repository-name/`
- **Build Configuration:** Update `package.json` build script for correct base path
- **Student Outcome:** "Your game will have a real web address that anyone can visit"

### **Slide 8: Project Configuration - Making It Deployment-Ready üîß**

- **Teaching Focus:** Understanding build configuration for deployment environments
- **Key Configuration:**
  - **Base path setting** in `package.json` for GitHub Pages subdirectory hosting
  - **Build script update** - `"vite build --base=/repo-name/"`
  - **Asset path resolution** - Ensures images and files load correctly
- **Build Path Rationale - Why This Configuration Matters:**
  - **Local Development Environment:** Vite dev server serves from root path (`http://localhost:5173/`)
  - **GitHub Pages Hosting:** Serves from user subdirectory (`https://username.github.io/repo-name/`)
  - **Path Resolution Problem:** Without base path configuration, the app looks for assets in wrong locations
  - **Build Configuration Solution:** `--base=/repo-name/` tells Vite to generate correct asset paths for subdirectory hosting
  - **Automatic Handling:** Once configured, Vite handles all path resolution differences between environments
- **Common Issues:**
  - **Blank page** - Usually incorrect base path configuration
  - **Missing assets** - Images/files not loading due to path issues
  - **404 errors** - Routing problems in single-page applications
- **Conceptual Understanding:** Students learn that deployment environments often differ from development environments, requiring build-time configuration
- **Student Preparation:** "This one configuration change makes deployment work correctly"

### **Slide 9: Authentication & Security - Connecting Safely üîê**

- **Teaching Focus:** Secure authentication for repository access
- **GitHub CLI Authentication:**
  - **Pre-installed** in Codespaces environment
  - **Browser-based flow** - Secure token generation
  - **One-time setup** - Credentials persist across sessions
- **Authentication Steps:**
  1. **`gh auth login`** - Start authentication process
  2. **Choose GitHub.com** - Select hosting platform
  3. **Choose HTTPS** - Secure connection protocol
  4. **Authenticate via browser** - Complete OAuth flow
  5. **Copy/paste code** - Verify identity
- **Security Benefits:**
  - **No password storage** - Uses secure tokens
  - **Scoped permissions** - Limited access to necessary operations
  - **Revocable access** - Can be disabled from GitHub settings
- **Student Assurance:** "This setup is more secure than username/password"
