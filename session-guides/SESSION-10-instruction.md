### **Slide 2: Version Control - Tracking Your Changes üìã**

- **Teaching Focus:** Why version control is essential for any serious development
- **Key Concepts:**
  - **Version control** as a system tracking file changes over time
  - **Problem-solving tool** for "it worked yesterday" and collaboration challenges
  - **Git** as the industry-standard version control system
  - **Repository** as project home containing code and complete history
  - **Branch** as a separate copy of your code for safe experimentation
- **Problems Version Control Solves:**
  - **Lost work** - Complete change history prevents data loss
  - **Breaking changes** - Rollback to any previous working version
  - **Collaboration conflicts** - Multiple developers can work simultaneously
  - **Change tracking** - See exactly what changed, when, and why
  - **Safe experimentation** - Branches let you try new features without breaking main code
- **Real-World Context:** "Every professional developer uses version control daily"
- **Student Connection:** "You'll use Git to save your progress and enable deployment"

### **Slide 3: Learn the Git Workflow üîÑ**

- **Teaching Focus:** The fundamental workflow that powers all software development
- **Context Setting:** "Whether you're fixing bugs, adding new features, or updating the design, you'll need a reliable way to manage and publish changes. That's where Git comes in."
- **Git Introduction:** "Git is a version control tool that helps you track your progress, explain what changed, and safely update your project. It works alongside GitHub (where your code lives) and GitHub Actions (which automatically rebuilds and redeploys your site every time you push changes)."
- **Learning Objective:** "In this section, you'll learn the three essential Git commands that power this workflow."
- **Visual:** Git workflow diagram showing how changes move from computer to live website
- **Emphasis:** "Once you push your code, GitHub takes care of the rest and automatically updates your game online"

- **The Three Essential Commands:**
  - **`git add .`** - Stage your changes ("get them ready to save")
  - **`git commit -m "message"`** - Save a snapshot with a message ("like a journal entry")
  - **`git push`** - Upload to GitHub ("share with the world and trigger deployment")

- **Visual Reference:**

- **Commit Message Convention:** Introduce the `type(scope): description` format with examples
- **Common Message Types Table:** Show feat, fix, style examples
- **Why It Matters:** "Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or updating the design, you'll follow the same workflow every time. This process helps you record your progress, explain what changed, and publish updates to your live site."
- **Student Application:** "This same pattern applies whether you're fixing a bug, adding a feature, or updating styles"

### **Slide 4: Git vs GitHub - Local and Remote üåê**

- **Teaching Focus:** Understanding the distinction between Git (local) and GitHub (remote)
- **Key Concepts:**
  - **Git** - Version control tool that runs on your computer (local)
  - **GitHub** - Cloud-based platform that hosts your repositories (remote)
  - **Local Repository** - Your project's version history stored on your computer
  - **Remote Repository** - Your project's version history stored on GitHub's servers
- **How They Work Together:**
  - **Local work** - You edit, stage, and commit changes on your computer using Git
  - **Remote sharing** - You push commits to GitHub to share and back up your work
  - **Synchronization** - Local and remote repositories stay in sync through push/pull operations
- **Why Both Matter:**
  - **Local** - Fast, works offline, your personal workspace
  - **Remote** - Backup, sharing, collaboration, deployment triggers
- **Student Connection:** "Your Codespace has Git installed locally, and you'll push to GitHub remotely"

### **Slide 5: Commit Messages - Creating Readable History üìù**

- **Teaching Focus:** How commit messages create a readable project history
- **Key Concept:** Every commit requires a message (any string) that explains what changed - these messages create a readable history like a diary of your project's evolution
- **Common Convention:** While commit messages can be any text, we'll introduce a popular format: `type(scope): description`
  - **Type examples:** `feat` (new feature), `fix` (bug fix), `style` (visual changes), `docs` (documentation)
  - **Scope examples:** `(quiz)`, `(scoring)`, `(logo)` - indicates what part of the app changed
  - **Description:** Clear, concise explanation of what you actually did
  - **Example:** `feat(logo): customize game title to Trivia Quest`
- **Why This Convention Helps:**
  - **Searchable history** - Easy to find specific types of changes
  - **Automated tools** - Many tools parse this format for release notes
  - **Team communication** - Consistent format improves collaboration
  - **Optional but valuable** - Teams choose conventions that work for them
- **Common Message Types:**

| Type | Example | What It Means |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **feat** | `feat(quiz): add timer` | New feature |
| **fix** | `fix(scoring): resolve bug` | Bug fix |
| **style** | `style(button): update colors` | Visual changes |

- **Updated Student Connection:** "These three commands ‚Äî add, commit, and push ‚Äî are like the secret handshake of software development. Once you get the hang of these, you're basically speaking the same language as the pros."

### **Slide 6: CI/CD - Automation That Changes Everything ‚öôÔ∏è**

- **Teaching Focus:** How automation transforms development workflows
- **Key Concepts:**
  - **Continuous Integration (CI)** - Automatically test and build code changes
  - **Continuous Deployment (CD)** - Automatically deploy successful builds
  - **GitHub Actions** - GitHub's automation platform for running workflows
  - **GitHub Pages** - Free hosting service for static websites
- **The Magic:** Push code ‚Üí Automatic build ‚Üí Automatic deployment ‚Üí Live website
