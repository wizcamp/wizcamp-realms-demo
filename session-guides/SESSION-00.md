# Session 0 â€” Getting Ready for Camp

Welcome to your pre-camp adventure! ðŸŽ’

[Course Name] allows you to experience the world from the perspective of a Junior Developer building a browser-based open-world trivia adventure game. Through hands-on coding challenges using tools like **React**, **Node.js**, **GitHub Codespaces**, and **Copilot**, you'll learn what it's like to think and work like a developerâ€”solving problems, bringing your ideas to life, and contributing to a cutting-edge web project.

Before you dive into building your trivia game, let's get your tools and accounts set up so you're ready to code!
