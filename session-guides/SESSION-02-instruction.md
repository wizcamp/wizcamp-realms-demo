1. **From SplashScreen to GameButton** - Recap the component swap from Session 1 and introduce the idea of building your own reusable UI elements
2. **React Components: Your First Custom Tags** - Define components as the building blocks of React apps and show how they encapsulate markup, styling, and logic
3. **JSX and Curly Braces** - Explain JSX syntax and how {} enables dynamic content, styling, and behavior inside components
4. **Props: Data and Behavior Flow** - Demonstrate how props allow parent components to pass information and actions to children
5. **Component Anatomy** - Break down a functional component into imports, function declaration, props destructuring, and JSX return
6. **Styling with Variants** - Use template literals and dynamic class names to style components based on props
7. **Functions as Props** - Show how components can trigger actions by receiving functions as props (e.g., onClick)
8. **Default Parameters and Destructuring** - Introduce fallback values and cleaner syntax for handling props
9. **VS Code Built-in Features** - Reinforce professional tooling with IntelliSense, auto-completion, and formatting

## Slide Deck Outline

### **Slide 1: Welcome Back to Component Land! 🧩**

- **Title:** "Session 2: Creating Reusable Components — Building Game Components"
- **Session 1 Recap:** "Last time: You set up your trivia game and experienced React's component system"
- **Hook:** "You've experienced React's magic — now let's build your own custom components!"
- **Today's Mission:**
  - **Create** your first reusable React component
  - **Master** props for component communication
  - **Style** components with variants
  - **Install** professional developer tools
  - **Experience** component composition in action
- **Visual:** LEGO blocks assembling into a complex structure
- **Connection:** "Remember swapping `<StartHere />` for `<SplashScreen />`? Today you'll create your own components to swap in!"

### **Slide 2: Components Are Digital LEGO Blocks 🧩**

- **Title:** "What Makes Components So Powerful?"
- **Key Points:**
  - **Reusable** - Write once, use everywhere
  - **Composable** - Small pieces build complex UIs
  - **Maintainable** - Change in one place, updates everywhere
  - **Testable** - Isolated pieces are easier to debug
- **Why Components Matter:**
  - **Scalability** - Apps with hundreds of components stay organized
  - **Team collaboration** - Different developers can work on different components
  - **Code quality** - Smaller pieces are easier to understand and debug
- **Real Example:** "A Button component can be used for 'Start Game', 'Credits', 'Submit Answer', etc."
- **Visual:** Component tree showing GameButton used in multiple places
- **Student Connection:** "You'll build a GameButton that works everywhere in your trivia game"

### **Slide 3: JSX Mastery - React's Special Language 🌟**

- **Title:** "JSX: The Language of React Components"
- **What is JSX?**
  - **JSX** = JavaScript XML - React's HTML-like syntax
  - Looks familiar but is actually JavaScript
  - Every React component returns JSX to describe its UI
- **File Extensions:** `.jsx` files clearly indicate JSX syntax
- **The Magic of Curly Braces {}:**
  ```javascript
  const name = "Alice";
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>; // Dynamic content!
  ```
- **JSX vs HTML - Key Differences:**
  - `className` instead of `class` (JavaScript reserved word)
  - `onClick` instead of `onclick` (camelCase convention)
  - `{expression}` for dynamic content
  - Self-closing tags required: `<img />` not `<img>`
- **JSX Gotchas to Remember:**
  - Always close tags: `<br />` not `<br>`
  - Use camelCase for event handlers: `onClick`, `onChange`
  - Wrap multi-line JSX in parentheses
- **Curly Brace Power in Action:**
  - `{text}` — displays variable content
  - `{onClick}` — passes function references
  - Dynamic CSS classes:
    ```javascript
    className={`game-button ${variant}`}
    ```
- **Student Connection:** "JSX + {} = unlimited UI possibilities!"

### **Slide 4: Anatomy of a React Component 🔬**

- **Title:** "Component Blueprint: What You'll Build Today"
- **Visual:** Annotated GameButton component with labeled parts

```javascript
// 1. Import statements (if needed)

// 2. Function declaration with props destructuring
export default function GameButton({ text, onClick, variant = "primary" }) {
  // 3. Logic/variables (optional)
  const buttonClass = `game-button ${variant}`;

  // 4. Return JSX - this is what gets rendered!
  return (
    <button className={buttonClass} onClick={onClick}>
      {text}
    </button>
  );
}
```

- **Usage Example:**

```javascript
<GameButton 
  text="Start Adventure" 
  onClick={() => alert('Game starting!')} 
  variant="primary" 
/>
```

- **Component Blueprint:**
  - **Props in** - text, onClick, variant
  - **Logic** - Dynamic class name creation
  - **JSX out** - Styled, interactive button
- **Student Focus:** "This is exactly what you'll build in the next 20 minutes!"

### **Slide 5: Props: The Component Communication System 📦**

- **Title:** "How Components Talk to Each Other"
- **Analogy:** "Props are like function parameters, but for React components"
- **Visual:** Parent-child diagram showing data flow
- **Key Rules:**
  - **One-way flow** - Parent to child only
  - **Read-only** - Child can't modify props
  - **Any data type** - strings, numbers, functions, objects
- **Common Prop Types:**
  - **string** - `text="Start Game"`
  - **function** - `onClick={() => alert('Hi!')}`
  - **boolean** - `isDisabled={false}`
  - **number** - `count={42}`
- **Props in Action Preview:** "Watch props flow from SplashScreen to GameButton in real-time"
- **Student Preview:** "You'll pass text, onClick, and variant as props to your GameButton!"

### **Slide 6: VS Code Built-in Features - Accelerate Your Development ⚡**

### **Slide 7: Functions as Props - Passing Behavior 🎯**

- **Title:** "Components That Do Things"
- **Concept:** "Props aren't just data — they can be functions too!"
- **Example:** `onClick={() => alert('Start Game!')}`
- **Benefits:**
  - **Flexible components** - Same button, different actions
  - **Separation of concerns** - Component handles UI, parent handles logic
  - **Reusability** - One component, many behaviors
- **Visual:** Same GameButton with different onClick behaviors
- **Student Preview:** "Your buttons will show alerts now, navigate screens later"
