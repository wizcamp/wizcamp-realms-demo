### Example 2: Creating Your Codespace (Session 1)

**Full Section:**

```markdown
## ☁️ Creating Your Codespace

🎯 **Goal:** Set up your cloud development environment so you can start coding without any local installations.

### Step 1: Sign in to GitHub

Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in with your account.

### Step 2: Launch the template

Go to [github.com/wizcamp/wizcamp-realms-demo](https://github.com/wizcamp/wizcamp-realms-demo) and click **Use this template** → **Open in a codespace**.

**Expected result:** Your Codespace begins building (this takes 1-2 minutes).

### Step 3: Wait for the environment to load

Once the build completes, VS Code will open in your browser.

**Expected result:** Project files appear in the file explorer on the left side.

### Step 4: Customize your theme (optional)

Click the ⚙️ gear icon in the bottom left → **Themes** → **Color Theme** → pick your favorite (Dark+ is popular for coding).

💡 **Why Codespaces rocks:** Everyone gets the same setup — no more "it works on my machine" drama. Mess something up? Just delete and start fresh. It's like having a reset button for your entire dev environment. You'll use this Codespace for all 12 sessions.

🏆 **Bonus Challenge:** Go to [github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces) to explore more about managing your Codespaces.
```

### Example 3: Starting Your Development Server (Session 1)

**Full Section:**

```markdown
## 🚀 Starting Your Development Server

🎯 **Goal:** Practice starting and stopping the local server you'll use to preview real-time changes as you build your app.

### Step 1: Run the dev server

From the terminal at the bottom of your Codespace, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Open the app in your browser

After running the command, you'll see output like:

```text
VITE v7.1.7  ready in 2473 ms

➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
➜  Network: use --host to expose
➜  press h + enter to show help
```

Follow the link (ctrl + click), copy-paste it into a new browser tab, or click "Open in Browser" if a dialog appears.

**Expected result:** A web page displaying the starter app with placeholder content.

### Step 3: Stop the server

Go back to your terminal and press `Ctrl + C`.

**Expected result:**

- Terminal returns to the command prompt
- Refreshing the browser shows a connection error (app no longer running)

💡 **Your dev server cheat sheet:** Run `npm run dev` to fire up your server and see your app live. Hit `Ctrl + C` to shut it down. You'll use these commands constantly — they're about to become muscle memory.
```

### Example 6: Using React DevTools for Exploring State (Session 3)

**Full Section:**

```markdown
## 🔍 Using React DevTools for Exploring State

Let's use React DevTools to see how **shared state** works behind the scenes and experiment with changing it manually.

1. **Open** DevTools by pressing F12 or right-clicking → Inspect
2. **Find** Components tab by looking for "Components" next to Console, Network, etc.
3. **Locate** GameProvider by clicking on GameProvider in the component tree
4. **Examine** the hooks by looking for the screen state value (if you don't see hook names clearly, click the gear icon and enable "Parse hook names")
5. **Experiment** with state by changing the screen value from "splash" to "playing" and watch the UI update!
6. **Change** it back by setting it back to "splash" to see the SplashScreen return

💡 React DevTools gives you X-ray vision into your app's **state**. You can see exactly what data each component has and even modify it in real-time. This is invaluable for debugging and understanding how **shared state** affects your entire app. Notice how changing one value in `GameProvider` instantly changes what component renders!

### 🏆 Bonus Challenge

Try changing the screen state to different values and see what happens. What occurs when you set it to a value that doesn't match any of your conditions?
```

**Characteristics:**
- Intro sentence with context
- Numbered steps (6 total)
- Bold action verbs
- No step subheadings
- No expected result statements
- Callout explaining concept
- Bonus challenge
