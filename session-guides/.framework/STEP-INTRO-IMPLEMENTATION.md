# Step Introduction Paragraph Implementation Summary

## Changes Completed

### Phase 1: Convention Documentation ✅

**File:** `.framework/CONVENTIONS.md`

Added comprehensive "Step Introduction Paragraphs" section with:
- Standard format: `[Action verb] [what to modify] [brief context]`
- Voice guidelines (imperative, not "you'll" or "we")
- Length guidelines (1-2 sentences max)
- Technical depth matching (simple/medium/complex)
- Common patterns by step type
- What to avoid
- Before/after examples

### Phase 2: Backport to SESSION-03 ✅

**Updated 9 step intro paragraphs:**

1. **Step 1 (Add imports to SplashScreen)**
   - Before: "To use React's state management and the credits modal, we need to import..."
   - After: "Add the imports for React's state management and the credits modal."

2. **Step 2 (Add local state)**
   - Before: "Create a state variable to track whether the modal is visible, starting with `false`... The `useState` hook returns..."
   - After: "Add state to track modal visibility, starting with `false` since the modal should be hidden initially."

3. **Step 3 (Update Credits button)**
   - Before: "Connect the Credits button to your state by updating its onClick handler..."
   - After: "Update the Credits button's onClick handler to show the modal when clicked."

4. **Step 4 (Add modal to JSX)**
   - Before: "Conditionally render the modal in your JSX so it only appears..."
   - After: "Add the modal with conditional rendering so it only appears when `showCredits` is true."

5. **Step 1 (Add imports to App)**
   - Before: "To access shared state and use screen constants, we need to import..."
   - After: "Add the imports for the `useGame` hook, `SCREENS` constants, and the `GameMap` component."

6. **Step 2 (Access shared state)**
   - Before: "Extract the `screen` value from Context using the `useGame` hook, which gives you access..."
   - After: "Add the `screen` value from the `useGame` hook to access the current screen state."

7. **Step 1 (Add imports to SplashScreen - second occurrence)**
   - Before: "To access screen constants and the shared state setter function, we need to import..."
   - After: "Add the imports for `SCREENS` constants and the `useGame` hook."

8. **Step 2 (Access state setter)**
   - Before: "Add `setScreen` to the `useGame` destructuring to access the function that updates..."
   - After: "Add the `setScreen` function from the `useGame` hook."

9. **Step 3 (Create start game function)**
   - Before: "Define a function that changes the screen state to PLAYING when called, triggering..."
   - After: "Add the `startGame` function that changes the screen state to PLAYING."

### Phase 3: Backport to SESSION-07 ✅

**Updated 5 step intro paragraphs:**

1. **Step 1 (Add QuizModal to App)**
   - Before: "Import QuizModal, add `isQuizVisible` to the destructuring, and conditionally render the modal."
   - After: "Add QuizModal to your app with import, destructuring, and conditional rendering."

2. **Step 2 (Update GameMap)**
   - Before: "Add `setIsQuizVisible` and call it after questions load — this sets the state to true, satisfying Step 1's condition and making the modal appear."
   - After: "Add `setIsQuizVisible` and call it after questions load to trigger the modal."

3. **Step 2 (Add component to JSX)**
   - Before: "Add the component to the JSX right after..."
   - After: "Add the component right after..."

4. **Step 3 (Update AnswerFeedback)**
   - Before: "Find the `AnswerFeedback` function and replace the placeholder message with random selection logic."
   - After: "Update the `AnswerFeedback` function to use random selection logic instead of the placeholder."

5. **Step 4 (Add AnswerFeedback to JSX)**
   - Before: "Add the component right after..."
   - After: "Add the AnswerFeedback component right after..."

## Key Improvements

### 1. Consistent Voice
All intro paragraphs now use imperative voice:
- ✅ "Add the import..."
- ✅ "Update the function..."
- ❌ Eliminated "To use...", "We need to...", "You'll..."

### 2. Reduced Verbosity
Removed unnecessary explanations that belong in Understanding callouts:
- Moved `useState` explanation from intro to callout
- Removed "which gives you access to..." type phrases
- Eliminated redundant context

### 3. Action-Oriented
Every intro now starts with a clear action verb:
- Add
- Update
- Find (when needed for context)

### 4. Appropriate Detail Level
Matched technical depth to step complexity:
- Simple steps: Brief, direct
- Complex steps: Added minimal context when needed

## Pattern Summary

### Most Common Patterns Applied

**Import Steps:**
> "Add the imports for [what they do]."

**Destructuring Steps:**
> "Add [what] from the [hook/function]."

**JSX Addition Steps:**
> "Add [component] [location]."

**Function Updates:**
> "Update [component/function] to [action]."

**Multi-Part Steps:**
> "Add [thing] with [list of actions]."

## Files Modified

1. `/session-guides/.framework/CONVENTIONS.md` - Added Step Introduction Paragraphs section
2. `/session-guides/SESSION-03.md` - Updated 9 step intro paragraphs
3. `/session-guides/SESSION-07.md` - Updated 5 step intro paragraphs

## Verification Checklist

For each updated intro paragraph:
- [x] Uses imperative voice
- [x] Starts with action verb
- [x] 1-2 sentences maximum
- [x] Focuses on WHAT, not HOW
- [x] Technical depth matches step complexity
- [x] No redundancy with code comments
- [x] No "To [purpose]..." constructions
- [x] No "we" or "you'll" voice

## Future Application

For new sessions or updates:
1. Check intro paragraph voice (imperative)
2. Verify length (1-2 sentences)
3. Confirm it states WHAT, not HOW
4. Match technical depth to step complexity
5. Use common patterns from CONVENTIONS.md
