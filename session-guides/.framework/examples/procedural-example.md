2. **Play** through at least two complete zones
3. **Test** all interactive features (buttons, navigation, scoring)
4. **Note** what works well and any issues you encounter

### Step 3: Review the code

1. **Open** the project's GitHub repository
2. **Read** through the main files: `App.jsx`, `GameContext.jsx`, and key components
3. **Look** for code organization, naming conventions, and comments
4. **Identify** strengths and areas for improvement

### Step 4: Write your feedback

Create a review covering:
- **What works well:** Specific features or code you liked (2-3 points)
