### Section 6: Starting Your Development Server

**📊 Variant:** C (Full) - 3 steps with commands

#### 🔴 Current

```markdown
## 🚀 Starting Your Development Server

🎯 **Goal:** Practice starting and stopping the local server you'll use to preview real-time changes as you build your app.

### Step 1: Run the dev server

From the terminal at the bottom of your Codespace, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Open the app in your browser

After running the command, you'll see output like:

```text
VITE v7.1.7  ready in 2473 ms

➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
➜  Network: use --host to expose
➜  press h + enter to show help
```

Follow the link (ctrl + click), copy-paste it into a new browser tab, or click "Open in Browser" if a dialog appears.

**Expected result:** A web page displaying the starter app with placeholder content.

### Step 3: Stop the server

Go back to your terminal and press `Ctrl + C`.

**Expected result:**

- Terminal returns to the command prompt
- Refreshing the browser shows a connection error (app no longer running)

💡 **Your dev server cheat sheet:** Run `npm run dev` to fire up your server and see your app live. Hit `Ctrl + C` to shut it down. You'll use these commands constantly — they're about to become muscle memory.
```

## Session 3: Managing Game Flow

### Section 9: Using React DevTools for Exploring State

**📊 Variant:** C (Full) - 6 exploratory steps

#### 🔴 Current

```markdown
## 🔍 Using React DevTools for Exploring State

Let's use React DevTools to see how **shared state** works behind the scenes and experiment with changing it manually.

1. **Open** DevTools by pressing F12 or right-clicking → Inspect
2. **Find** Components tab by looking for "Components" next to Console, Network, etc.
3. **Locate** GameProvider by clicking on GameProvider in the component tree
4. **Examine** the hooks by looking for the screen state value (if you don't see hook names clearly, click the gear icon and enable "Parse hook names")
5. **Experiment** with state by changing the screen value from "splash" to "playing" and watch the UI update!
6. **Change** it back by setting it back to "splash" to see the SplashScreen return

💡 React DevTools gives you X-ray vision into your app's **state**. You can see exactly what data each component has and even modify it in real-time. This is invaluable for debugging and understanding how **shared state** affects your entire app. Notice how changing one value in `GameProvider` instantly changes what component renders!

### 🏆 Bonus Challenge

Try changing the screen state to different values and see what happens. What occurs when you set it to a value that doesn't match any of your conditions?
```

#### 🟢 Proposed

```markdown
## 🔍 Using React DevTools for Exploring State

🎯 **Goal:** Explore how shared state controls your app by manually changing values in DevTools.

### Step 1: Open DevTools

Press `F12` or right-click → Inspect to open your browser's developer tools.

### Step 2: Navigate to Components tab

Look for "Components" next to Console, Network, etc. and click it.

**Expected result:** You see a tree of React components.

### Step 3: Locate GameProvider

Click on GameProvider in the component tree.

**Expected result:** The right panel shows GameProvider's hooks and state.

### Step 4: Find the screen state

Look for the `screen` state value in the hooks section. If hook names aren't clear, click the gear icon and enable "Parse hook names."

### Step 5: Experiment with state

Change the `screen` value from `"splash"` to `"playing"` and watch the UI update instantly!

### Step 6: Change it back

Set `screen` back to `"splash"` to see the SplashScreen return.

**Verify:** The app switches between screens as you change the state value.

💡 **Why this matters:** React DevTools gives you X-ray vision into your app's state. You can see exactly what data each component has and modify it in real-time — invaluable for debugging and understanding how shared state affects your entire app.

🏆 **Bonus Challenge:** Try changing the screen state to different values and see what happens. What occurs when you set it to a value that doesn't match any of your conditions?
