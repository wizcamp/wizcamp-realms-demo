6. ❌ "Add AnswerFeedback to JSX" → ✅ "Add AnswerFeedback to QuizModal"

### Sessions Not Changed

- **SESSION-01**: Setup steps, generic is appropriate
- **SESSION-02**: Already follows best practices
- **SESSION-04**: Already follows best practices

## Impact

### Before
- Generic names made steps hard to scan
- Difficult to find specific steps when referencing
- Inconsistent patterns across sessions
- Context lost when viewed in isolation

### After
- Specific names improve scannability
- Easy to find steps by entity name
- Consistent pattern across all sessions
- Names provide context even in isolation

## Examples of Improvement

### SESSION-05 Transformation Steps
**Before:**
- Step 2: Extract object properties
- Step 3: Add decoding
- Step 4: Shuffle answers
- Step 5: Return game format

**After:**
- Step 2: Extract properties in transformQuestion
- Step 3: Add decoding to transformQuestion
- Step 4: Shuffle answers in transformQuestion
- Step 5: Return game format from transformQuestion

**Benefit:** Clear that all steps modify the same function

### SESSION-06 Helper Functions
**Before:**
- Step 1: Add key generation
- Step 2: Add cache retrieval
- Step 3: Add cache storage

**After:**
- Step 1: Create getCacheKey function
- Step 2: Create getCachedQuestions function
- Step 3: Create setCachedQuestions function

**Benefit:** Clear what functions are being created

### SESSION-07 Component Building
**Before:**
- Step 2: Add component to JSX
- Step 4: Add AnswerFeedback to JSX

**After:**
- Step 2: Add AnswerChoices to QuizModal
- Step 4: Add AnswerFeedback to QuizModal

**Benefit:** Clear what's being added and where

## Format Patterns Applied

### Creating (7 instances)
- "Create [EntityName] [type]"
- Examples: "Create getCacheKey function", "Create AnswerChoices component"

### Modifying (11 instances)
- "Add [feature] to [EntityName]"
- Examples: "Add fetch logic to fetchQuestions", "Add decoding to transformQuestion"

### Adding (4 instances)
- "Add [EntityName] to [ParentEntity]"
- Examples: "Add AnswerChoices to QuizModal", "Add AnswerFeedback to QuizModal"

### State Access (3 instances)
- "Access [stateName] from [source]"
- Examples: "Access screen from useGame", "Access setScreen from useGame"

### Purpose-Driven (1 instance)
- "Disable buttons after answer selection"
- Used when action is more important than entity

## Verification

All changes verified:
- ✅ Step headings updated
- ✅ Step intro paragraphs still make sense
- ✅ No broken internal references
- ✅ Sequential numbering maintained
- ✅ Consistent pattern within each session

## Conclusion

All 20 identified step names have been updated to follow the "Always Specific" principle. The guides now have consistent, scannable step names that provide context and make it easy for students to find and reference specific steps.
