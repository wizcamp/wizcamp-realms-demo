**Structure:**
```markdown
## 📚📋 Essential Terms

_Quick reference for all the tools and concepts you just experienced:_

| Term | Definition | Why it matters |
```

**Characteristics:**
- Always 3-column table
- Terms include emojis
- Appears near end (before Ask the AI)
- 5-10 terms per session

---

### 8. **Special Sections: Ask the AI**
**Pattern:** End-of-session reflection prompts
**Emoji:** 🤖 (always)
**Appears:** Every session (1-11)

**Structure:**
```markdown
## 🤖 Ask the AI — [Session Topic]

[Accomplishment recap]

[Transition about understanding]

- **[Question]**
[5-7 questions]
```

**Characteristics:**
- Always includes session topic in title
- Starts with accomplishment recap
- 5-7 bold questions
- Final section of every session

---

## Formatting Patterns Observed

### Comparison Tables
Used in "Understanding" sections to contrast concepts:
```markdown
| **Props** | **State** |
|-----------|-----------|
| Read-only | Changeable |
```

### Problem/Solution Format
Used in "Why" sections:
```markdown
**The Problem:** [pain points]
**The Solution:** [approach]
```

### Figures with Captions
Used throughout for visual aids:
```html
<img src="..." alt="..." style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%;">
*Figure: Description*
```

### Italicized Intro/Context
Used for setting context:
```markdown
_Before we dive into code, let's understand..._
_Quick orientation to help you find files..._
```

### Transitional Endings
Bridge to next section:
```markdown
Now let's build your first custom component and see that power in action.
```

## Key Insights from Course-Wide Analysis

### 1. Conceptual Sections Precede Action
Almost all conceptual sections appear BEFORE hands-on work, providing context and mental models.

### 2. Visual Aids Are Common
Many conceptual sections include:
- Comparison tables
- File tree diagrams
- Architecture diagrams
- Flowcharts

### 3. Conversational Tone Throughout
- Uses "you" and "your"
- Asks rhetorical questions
- Provides reassurance
- Makes analogies

### 4. Consistent Special Sections
- Essential Terms: Every session, same format
- Ask the AI: Every session, same structure

### 5. Emoji Usage Patterns
- 💡 🧠 = Understanding/concepts
- ⚡ = Why/motivation
- 🔍 📋 🏗️ = Exploring/examining
- 🔄 = Flow/process
- 🗂️ = Navigation/structure
- 🪝 🔗 🔊 = Specific technical concepts

## Updated Pattern Variants

### Variant A: Simple Explanation (1-3 Paragraphs)
**No change needed** - Current documentation covers this

---

### Variant B: Structured Explanation (With Visuals)
**Enhancement needed:** Add sub-variants for common structures

**Sub-variant B1: Understanding (Concept Explanation)**
- Opens with context/why
- Comparison table or diagram
- Explanation paragraphs
- Transitional ending

**Sub-variant B2: Why (Motivation/Rationale)**
- Problem/Solution format
- Bullet lists
- Real-world context
- Brief (2-4 paragraphs)

**Sub-variant B3: Exploring (Discovery/Investigation)**
- Introduction to what's being explored
- Code examples or tool demonstration
- Significance explanation
- Medium length (2-5 paragraphs)

**Sub-variant B4: Data Flow/Architecture**
- Step-by-step flow
- Numbered lists or diagrams
- How pieces connect
- Medium-long (3-6 paragraphs)

---

## Recommendations for Pattern Documentation

### 1. Add Sub-Variants to Variant B
Document the four common structures observed:
- Understanding (concept explanation)
- Why (motivation)
- Exploring (discovery)
- Data Flow (architecture)

### 2. Emphasize Transitional Endings
Many conceptual sections bridge to the next hands-on section with transitional sentences.

### 3. Document Comparison Table Format
This is a very common pattern in Understanding sections.

### 4. Document Problem/Solution Format
Used specifically in "Why" sections.

### 5. Clarify Visual Aid Usage
- When to use diagrams
- When to use tables
- When to use code blocks

---

## Pattern Documentation Status

**Current documentation covers:**
- ✅ Variant A (Simple)
- ✅ Variant B (Structured) - but needs sub-variants
- ✅ Essential Terms special section
- ✅ Ask the AI special section
- ✅ Basic formatting conventions

**Needs enhancement:**
- ⚠️ Sub-variants for Variant B
- ⚠️ Comparison table format
- ⚠️ Problem/Solution format
- ⚠️ Transitional ending guidance
- ⚠️ More visual aid examples

---

## Next Steps

1. Update `patterns/conceptual.md` with sub-variants
2. Add comparison table and Problem/Solution examples
3. Add transitional ending guidance
4. Update `examples/conceptual-example.md` with new sub-variants
5. Validate against Session 1 content
