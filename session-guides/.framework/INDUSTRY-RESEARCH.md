## Customizing the package.json questionnaire

If you expect to create many package.json files...
```

**Key Observations:**
- Numbered steps when sequential
- Commands in code blocks
- Context before steps

## Pattern Comparison Matrix

| Element | GitHub | npm | VS Code | Our Current |

## Key Insights

### What Industry Does Well

1. **Context before action** - All explain "why" before "how"
2. **Implicit verification** - Assumes success, no explicit "Expected result"
3. **Command-first for CLI** - Show command, then explain
4. **Numbered steps only when sequential** - Not for every instruction
5. **Platform-specific sections** - Tables or separate sections
6. **Next steps** - Links to related tasks
7. **Multiple examples** - Show variations and use cases

### What We Do Differently

1. **Explicit verification** - "Expected result" statements
2. **Goal statements** - Upfront learning objective
3. **Emoji callouts** - Visual "why this matters"
4. **Step subheadings** - More structure than industry
5. **Bonus challenges** - Extension activities
6. **Expected output** - Show terminal output

### What We Should Consider

**Keep (unique value):**
- Explicit verification (helps beginners)
- Goal statements (learning-focused)
- Emoji callouts (engaging, scannable)
- Expected output (reduces confusion)

**Adopt from industry:**
- "Next steps" section (connects tasks)
- Multiple examples (shows variations)
- Implicit verification for simple tasks
- Less structure for 1-2 step tasks

**Refine:**
- Step subheadings (only for 4+ steps?)
- Numbered steps (only when truly sequential?)
- Callout placement (integrate better?)

## Recommended Hybrid Approach

### For Simple Configs (1-2 steps)
**Industry style:** Minimal, paragraph format
```markdown
## Section Title

Navigate to [service] and create an account. If you already have one, verify you can log in.

üí° **Why this matters:** Brief explanation.
```

### For Medium Configs (3-4 steps)
**Hybrid:** Numbered steps + our enhancements
```markdown
## Section Title

üéØ **Goal:** What you'll accomplish.

1. **Action** with context
2. **Action** with context
3. **Action** with context

**Verify:** Brief check.

üí° **Why this matters:** Brief explanation.
```

### For Complex Configs (5+ steps)
**Our current style:** Full structure
```markdown
## Section Title

üéØ **Goal:** What you'll accomplish.

### Step 1: Action Name
Context and instruction.
```bash
command
```
**Expected result:** What you should see.

### Step 2: Action Name
[Continue...]

üí° **Why this matters:** Brief explanation.

üèÜ **Bonus Challenge:** Extension activity.
```
