# SESSION-09.md Convention Issues

## Critical Issues

### 1. Essential Terms Bolding Violations

**Issue:** "custom hooks" is bolded twice in the Custom Hooks section
- **Line 27:** First occurrence (correct): "let's understand **custom hooks**"
- **Line 29:** Second occurrence (incorrect): "**Custom hooks** are functions..."
- **Line 41:** Third occurrence (incorrect): "**Custom hooks** embody one of programming's..."
- **Line 51:** Fourth occurrence (incorrect): "Custom hooks let you **\"write once, use often,\"**"

**Fix:** Only bold on first occurrence (line 27). Remove bold from lines 29, 41, and 51.

---

**Issue:** "HTMLAudioElement" is bolded three times in Browser Audio APIs section
- **Line 61:** First occurrence (correct): "Let's understand the **HTMLAudioElement**"
- **Line 63:** Second occurrence (incorrect): "**HTMLAudioElement** is the JavaScript version..."
- **Line 85:** Third occurrence (incorrect): "The **HTMLAudioElement** gives you..."

**Fix:** Only bold on first occurrence (line 61). Remove bold from lines 63 and 85.

---

**Issue:** "refs" is bolded twice in Refs and useRef section
- **Line 91:** First occurrence (correct): "Now let's understand **refs**"
- **Line 93:** Second occurrence (incorrect): "**Refs** are like bookmarks..."
- **Line 145:** Third occurrence (incorrect): "**Refs** are perfect for storing..."

**Fix:** Only bold on first occurrence (line 91). Remove bold from lines 93 and 145.

---

**Issue:** "state" is bolded in Refs and useRef section but is not an Essential Term for this session
- **Line 93:** "Unlike **state**, changing a ref..."

**Fix:** Remove bold from "state" - it's an Essential Term from a previous session, not this one.

---

**Issue:** "lazy initialization" is bolded twice
- **Line 267:** First occurrence in Understanding callout (correct): "The `if (!audioRef.current)` check is an example of **lazy initialization**"
- **Line 285:** Second occurrence in Understanding callout (incorrect): "The **lazy initialization** pattern ensures..."

**Fix:** Only bold on first occurrence (line 267). Remove bold from line 285.

---

### 2. Accessing Your Codespace Heading Level

**Issue:** Uses `##` heading level instead of `####`
- **Line 21:** `## ‚òÅÔ∏è Accessing Your Codespace`

**Fix:** Change to `#### ‚òÅÔ∏è Accessing Your Codespace` per CONVENTIONS.md

---

### 3. Essential Terms Table Formatting

**Issue:** Essential Terms table uses incorrect emoji column format
- **Current:** Terms have emojis in the Term column (ü™ù custom hook, üîÑ DRY, etc.)
- **Expected:** Per quality check prompt, table should use `| Term   | Definition | Why it matters |` format

**Note:** This appears to be intentional based on the pattern. Verify if this is the correct format or if emojis should be removed from the Term column.

---

## Minor Issues

### 4. Code Comment Style

**Issue:** Inline comments in code blocks that explain obvious actions
- **Line 172:** `import { getAssetPath } from "../utils/assets";` - No comment needed (obvious import)
- **Line 189:** No inline comments in MusicToggle component (good - code is self-explanatory)

**Status:** Generally good - most code blocks don't have unnecessary comments.

---

### 5. Step Introduction Paragraphs

**Issue:** Some step intros could be more concise
- **Line 168:** "Add the asset utility import at the top of the file." - Good, concise
- **Line 178:** "Add the MusicToggle component after the CurrentZone function." - Good, concise
- **Line 213:** "Update the HUD JSX return to include the MusicToggle component." - Good, concise

**Status:** Step intros are generally well-written and follow conventions.

---

### 6. Understanding Callout Usage

**Issue:** Some Understanding callouts could be more concise
- **Lines 283-285:** "Preventing Audio Chaos" callout is good but slightly verbose

**Status:** Generally acceptable - callouts provide valuable context.

---

## Summary of Required Fixes

### High Priority (Must Fix)

1. **Remove duplicate bolding of "custom hooks"** (lines 29, 41, 51)
2. **Remove duplicate bolding of "HTMLAudioElement"** (lines 63, 85)
3. **Remove duplicate bolding of "refs"** (lines 93, 145)
4. **Remove bold from "state"** (line 93) - not an Essential Term for this session
5. **Remove duplicate bolding of "lazy initialization"** (line 285)
6. **Change Accessing Your Codespace heading** from `##` to `####` (line 21)

### Medium Priority (Should Review)

7. **Verify Essential Terms table format** - confirm if emoji in Term column is correct

### Low Priority (Optional)

8. Review Understanding callouts for conciseness (generally good as-is)
