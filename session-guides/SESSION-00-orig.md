# Session 0 — Getting Ready for Camp

Welcome to your pre-camp adventure! 🎒

[Course Name] allows you to experience the world from the perspective of a Junior Developer building a browser-based open-world trivia adventure game. Through hands-on coding challenges using tools like **React**, **Node.js**, **GitHub Codespaces**, and **Copilot**, you'll learn what it's like to think and work like a developer—solving problems, bringing your ideas to life, and contributing to a cutting-edge web project.

Before you dive into building your trivia game, let's get your tools and accounts set up so you're ready to code!

## 👋 Introducing Yourself

**Goal:** Connect with your cohort and share your coding journey.

### Step 1: Log in to the portal

Go to the [Wizcamp Portal](https://portal.wizcamp.com) and log in with your account.

### Step 2: Create your post

Click "New Introduction" and share:

- Your name and coding experience
- What excites you about learning to code
- One fun fact about yourself

### Step 3: Engage with others

Read and respond to other student introductions.

💡 **Why this matters:** Building connections with your cohort creates a supportive learning community where you can share challenges, celebrate wins, and learn from each other throughout the course.

## 🐙 Setting Up Your GitHub Account

Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and create a new account ([signup guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github#signing-up-for-a-new-personal-account)). If you already have an account, verify you can log in.

💡 **Why GitHub matters:** GitHub is where developers worldwide store and share code. You'll use it throughout the course to access your coding environment and AI-powered coding assistant.
