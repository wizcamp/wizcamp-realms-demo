## ü™ù Custom Hooks in React

Hooks help you organize React code and avoid duplication. React gives you built-in hooks like `useState` and `useRef` for common tasks. You can also write your own custom hooks ‚Äî functions that start with "use" and combine built-in hooks to package logic you'll reuse across components.

You've already been using one ‚Äî `useGame()` is a custom hook! Here's how it works:

```javascript
// Custom hook definition (in src/hooks/useGame.js)
export function useGame() {
  const context = useContext(GameContext);
  return context;
}

// Using the custom hook (in any component)
function MyComponent() {
  const { score } = useGame();  // Access shared state
}
```

Hooks follow **"Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY)** ‚Äî instead of copying audio logic into every component that needs music, you write it once in a hook and reuse it. Your `useAudio` hook will follow this pattern:

```javascript
const music = useAudio('/music.mp3');
```

Now any component can add background music with a single line of code.

<a id="browser-audio-apis"></a>

## üîä Browser Audio APIs

Let's understand the **HTMLAudioElement** ‚Äî the browser's built-in interface for controlling audio playback.

You might be familiar with HTML audio elements like `<audio src="music.mp3"></audio>` that you write in HTML files. HTMLAudioElement is the JavaScript version ‚Äî it's a music player you create and control with code. Instead of writing HTML tags, you use `new Audio()` to create the player, then control it with methods like `play()` and `pause()`.

Think of it like the play/pause buttons on a music player ‚Äî but instead of clicking buttons, your code sends commands. You can tell it to play, pause, adjust volume, loop tracks ‚Äî all through JavaScript.

### Creating Audio Elements

```javascript
// Create new audio element
const audio = new Audio(getAssetPath('audio/theme-music.mp3'));

// Configure audio properties
audio.loop = true;        // Repeat when finished
audio.volume = 0.5;       // 50% volume
```

### Audio Control Methods

```javascript
// Playback control
audio.play();             // Start playing
audio.pause();            // Stop playing

// Properties
audio.currentTime = 0;    // Reset to beginning
audio.muted = true;       // Mute audio
```

In the upcoming sections, you'll wrap these audio controls in a custom hook, making it easy to add music to any component in your game.

<a id="refs-and-useref"></a>

## üîó Refs and useRef

You need a place to store your audio player so you can control it‚Äîplay, pause, adjust volume. If you use state, every interaction with the audio would trigger a re-render, even though nothing on screen needs to change.

The **`useRef`** hook creates a **ref**‚Äîa place to store something that stays put between renders. When you update what's in a ref, your component doesn't re-render.

### Creating a Ref

The `useRef` hook creates a ref that starts empty (or whatever starting value you give it):

```javascript
const audioRef = useRef(null);  // Create an empty ref
```

The ref has a `current` property where you store things:

```javascript
audioRef.current = new Audio('music.mp3');   // Store the audio player
audioRef.current.play();                     // Use it later
```

### Why Refs for Audio?

You need to keep the same audio player around so you can control it‚Äîplay it, pause it, change the volume. If you created a new audio player on every render, the music would restart constantly. A ref solves this by holding onto the same value‚Äîin this case, your audio player‚Äîacross re-renders.

### The Pattern You'll Use

```javascript
function useAudio(src) {
  const audioRef = useRef(null);          // Create a place to store audio player
  
  const play = () => {
    if (!audioRef.current) {              // If we haven't created the player yet
      audioRef.current = new Audio(src);  // Create it and store it
    }
    audioRef.current.play();              // Use the stored player
  };
}
```

The first time `play()` runs, `audioRef.current` is `null`, so it creates the audio player and stores it. Every time after that, it reuses the same player. This means your music doesn't restart every time the component re-renders‚Äîthe player persists in memory.

<a id="building-the-musictoggle-component"></a>

## üéõÔ∏è Building the MusicToggle Component

üéØ **Goal:** Add the UI controls you'll need to test the audio functionality as you build it.

This music toggle will provide the interface for testing the `useAudio` hook as you implement it in the next sections.

### Step 1: Add asset utility import

**File:** `src/components/HUD.jsx`

Add the asset utility import at the top of the file.

```javascript
import { getAssetPath } from "../utils/assets";
```

### Step 2: Create MusicToggle component

**File:** `src/components/HUD.jsx`

Add the MusicToggle component after the CurrentZone function.

```javascript
function MusicToggle() {
  const { music } = useGame();  // Access music controls from shared state
  return (
    <button 
      onClick={music.toggle}
      className="music-toggle"
      title={music.isPlaying ? "Pause Music" : "Play Music"}
    >
      <img 
        src={getAssetPath(
          music.isPlaying ? "images/playing.svg" : "images/paused.svg"
        )}
        alt={music.isPlaying ? "Pause" : "Play"}
        className="music-icon"
        width={24}
        height={24}
      />
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Step 3: Add MusicToggle to HUD

**File:** `src/components/HUD.jsx`

Update the HUD JSX return to include the MusicToggle component.

```javascript
export default function HUD() {
  return (
    <>
      <Scoreboard />
      <CurrentZone />
      <MusicToggle />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Step 4: Test music toggle visibility

Start the game and navigate to the playing screen.

**‚úì You should see:** Music toggle button is visible but inoperable when clicked (audio functionality not yet implemented).

> üí° **Conditional Rendering with Dynamic Content**
>
> The MusicToggle component demonstrates conditional rendering with dynamic images and tooltips. The `music.isPlaying` state controls both the icon and the tooltip text, providing clear visual feedback to users. This pattern ‚Äî using state to drive multiple UI elements ‚Äî creates cohesive, responsive interfaces.

<a id="adding-audio-reference-to-useaudio"></a>

## üìª Adding Audio Reference to useAudio

üéØ **Goal:** Add the audio reference to your `useAudio` hook so it can store the HTMLAudioElement.

You'll add a ref to store the audio element and import the necessary React hooks.

### Step 1: Add useRef import

**File:** `src/hooks/useAudio.js`

Add the useRef import at the top of the file.

```javascript
import { useRef, useState } from "react";
```

### Step 2: Add audio reference to hook

**File:** `src/hooks/useAudio.js`

Add the audio reference inside the `useAudio` function.

```javascript
export function useAudio(src) {
  const audioRef = useRef(null); // Add audio reference
  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);
  
  // ... rest of hook
}
```

Your hook now has a ref that can store and remember the audio element you'll create in the `play` function. The ref starts as `null` and will hold your audio element once it's created.

### Audio Reference Flow

```text
useAudio hook called ‚Üí audioRef.current is null ‚Üí play() creates new Audio() ‚Üí 
audioRef.current stores Audio element ‚Üí future calls reuse same element
```

> üí° **Persistent Storage Across Re-renders**
>
> The `audioRef` you just created provides persistent storage for the audio element across component re-renders. Without refs, you'd create a new audio element every time the component updates, causing audio to restart unexpectedly. Refs solve this by maintaining the same reference to the audio object throughout the component's lifecycle.

<a id="implementing-audio-playback"></a>

## üéµ Implementing Audio Playback

üéØ **Goal:** Implement the core audio functionality by updating the `play` function to create and control audio elements.

You'll add lazy initialization to create the audio element only when needed, then configure and play it.

### Step 1: Update play function

**File:** `src/hooks/useAudio.js`

Update the play function to create and control the audio element.

```javascript
const play = () => {
  // [1] Lazy initialization
  if (!audioRef.current) {
    audioRef.current = new Audio(src);
    audioRef.current.loop = true;
    audioRef.current.volume = 0.5;
  }
  audioRef.current.play();  // [2] Play audio
  setIsPlaying(true);       // [3] Update state
};
```

> üí° **Understanding Lazy Initialization**
>
> 1. **Lazy initialization**: Create audio element only when first needed ‚Äî the `if (!audioRef.current)` check ensures the audio element is created once and reused
> 2. **Play audio**: Call the browser's play method to start playback
> 3. **Update state**: Set `isPlaying` to true so UI reflects the playing state
>
> The `if (!audioRef.current)` check is an example of **lazy initialization** ‚Äî creating a resource only when it's first needed. Since `audioRef.current` starts as `null`, the first time `play()` runs it creates the audio element. Every time after that, `audioRef.current` contains the audio element, so the `if` condition is false and it skips creating a new one.

### Step 2: Test audio playback

Click the music toggle button.

**‚úì You should see:** Game theme plays and button shows playing state (icon changes).

> üí° **Preventing Audio Chaos**
>
> Creating audio elements only once and reusing them prevents overlapping sounds, memory leaks, and performance issues. Without this pattern, clicking the music toggle rapidly would create multiple audio elements playing simultaneously, causing audio chaos and slowing down your browser. The lazy initialization pattern ensures clean, efficient audio management.

Use this workflow during your Solo Mission and anytime you're stuck or want to improve your code.

<a id="solo-mission-complete-useaudio-hook"></a>

## üéñÔ∏è Solo Mission: Complete useAudio Hook

You've built audio playback with guidance ‚Äî now it's your turn to complete the hook with pause controls, error handling, and cleanup using AI assistance.

### What You're Building

A complete audio hook with pause functionality, error handling for failed playback, and cleanup that prevents memory leaks when components unmount.

---

### Phase 1: Pause Functionality

üéØ **Goal:** Stop audio playback and update state

**Your Task:**

Update the `pause` function in `src/hooks/useAudio.js` to:

- Call `audioRef.current.pause()`
- Set `isPlaying` to `false`

**Test:** Click music toggle while audio is playing ‚Üí music stops, icon changes to paused state

---

### Phase 2: Error Handling

üéØ **Goal:** Prevent audio failures from crashing the app

**Your Tasks:**

1. Open `src/hooks/useAudio.js` and use GitHub Copilot:
   
   > ü§ñ **AI Prompt:**
   >
   > `/fix Add error handling to the play function in the useAudio hook so that if the audio fails to play, it catches the error, logs a warning, and updates isPlaying to false`
2. Review and apply the generated code

**Test error handling:**

1. Open `src/context/GameContext.jsx`
2. Locate
   ```javascript
   const music = useAudio(getAssetPath("audio/dramatic-action.mp3"));
   ```
3. Change path to `"audio/nonexistent.mp3"` (keep the `getAssetPath()` wrapper)
4. Click music toggle ‚Üí check browser console for error message
5. Revert path to `"audio/dramatic-action.mp3"` after testing

**‚úì You should see:** Console shows error, app doesn't crash, and `isPlaying` stays false

<img src="https://placehold.co/500x100?text=Console+Error+Message" alt="Browser console showing error: useAudio.js:28 Audio failed to play: NotSupportedError" style="max-width: 500px; width: 100%;">
*Figure: Error handling prevents crashes and logs helpful debugging information*

---

### Phase 3: Cleanup Function

üéØ **Goal:** Prevent memory leaks by cleaning up when the hook unmounts

**Your Tasks:**

1. Open `src/hooks/useAudio.js` and use GitHub Copilot:
   
   > ü§ñ **AI Prompt:**
   >
   > `/fix Add a useEffect cleanup function to the useAudio hook that stops the audio and clears the reference when the component unmounts`
2. Review and apply the generated code

**Verify:** Check that your hook includes a `useEffect` with cleanup that pauses audio and clears the ref

---

### ‚úÖ Success Review

Your completed `useAudio` hook should:

- Export `play`, `pause`, `toggle`, and `isPlaying`
- Successfully toggle audio playback on/off
- Handle errors when attempting to play audio
- Set `isPlaying` to false if an error occurs
- Include a `useEffect` cleanup function for component unmounting
- Prevent memory leaks when navigating between screens

## üìö Essential Terms

_Quick reference for all the custom hooks and browser API concepts you just learned:_

| Term   | Definition | Why it matters |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| üîÑ DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) | A fundamental programming principle that emphasizes eliminating code duplication through reusable solutions. | Custom hooks embody DRY by packaging complex logic into reusable functions. |
| üîä HTMLAudioElement | Part of the Web API that provides an interface for controlling audio playback, with methods like play(), pause(), and properties like volume and loop. | Gives you programmatic control over audio files in web applications. |
| üîó ref | A way to access DOM elements or store values that don't cause re-renders when changed. | Perfect for storing audio elements that need to persist but don't affect UI rendering. |
| üéØ useRef | A React hook that creates a persistent reference to a DOM element or value that doesn't cause re-renders when it changes. | Essential for storing audio elements and other browser API objects across component updates. |
| üîÑ mutable | Data that can be changed or modified after it's created, as opposed to immutable data that cannot be changed. | Refs store mutable values that can be updated without triggering re-renders, perfect for audio objects that change state. |
| ‚è≥ lazy initialization | A pattern where resources are created only when first needed, rather than upfront. | Avoids unnecessary setup and ensures efficient resource reuse, like creating audio elements only when play() is first called. |
