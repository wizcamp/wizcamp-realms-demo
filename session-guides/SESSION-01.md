# Session 1 — Setting Up Your Trivia Game

Welcome to **React** Development! 🎉

You're about to launch your dev setup and start building like a pro. This guide breaks everything down into bite-sized tasks so you can move fast, learn by doing, and see results right away. Ready to dive in? Let's go!

## 🔧 Launch Your Codespace

Let's get your cloud coding environment up and running so you can start building without messing with local installs. This is your dev playground in the cloud — no setup headaches, no installs, just code.

1. Head over to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in using the account you set up during pre-camp.
2. Go to [github.com/wizcamp/wizcamp-realms-demo](https://github.com/wizcamp/wizcamp-realms-demo) and click **Use this template → Open in codespace**.
3. Wait a bit while your Codespace builds. You'll see a VS Code editor pop up in your browser.
4. Once it loads, make sure you can see the project files in the file explorer on the left.
5. **Customize your theme**: Click the gear icon in the bottom left, go to **Themes -> Color Theme**, and pick your favorite (Dark+ is popular for coding).

### 💡 Why This Matters

Codespaces give everyone the same setup — no more "it works on my machine" drama. If you mess something up, just delete and start fresh. It's like having a reset button for your entire dev environment. You will use this Codespace for all sessions.

## 🗂️ Project Navigation

_Quick orientation to help you find files during today's tasks:_

```text
wizcamp-realms-demo/
├── src/                    # Your React code lives here
│   ├── components/         # React components (SplashScreen, etc.)
│   └── App.jsx             # Main app component (you'll edit this!)
├── public/                 # Static files (images, etc.)
├── session-guides/         # Step-by-step guides (like this one)
├── index.html              # HTML entry point (you'll edit this too!)
└── package.json            # Project configuration (npm scripts, dependencies)
```

**For today's tasks, you'll only work with:**

- `src/App.jsx` — to swap components
- `index.html` — to update the page title
- `session-guides/` — for instructions (that's where you are now!)

_Don't worry about the other folders yet — we'll explore them in future sessions._

## 🚀 Start the Development Server

Preview the app in your browser by running the dev server to confirm everything is wired up correctly.

1. Launch the dev server from the terminal: `npm run dev`.
2. Click "Open in Browser" or visit the provided localhost URL (e.g., http://localhost:5173/).
3. The starter app should load, showing a placeholder component.

### 💡 Why This Matters

Your dev server is like having a live preview of your creation. Every change you make shows up instantly — you're watching your code come to life in real-time.

### 🏆 Bonus Challenge

Try stopping and restarting the dev server:

- Stop the server with `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.
- Check localhost again to see the app is gone.
- Restart it with `npm run dev` and refresh the browser to see the app again.

<a id="replace-the-placeholder-component"></a>

## 🧩 Replace the Placeholder Component

With the development server still running, replace the placeholder component with the game's splash screen component to experience live updates in action.

1. **Open `src/App.jsx`**
2. **Add the import**: `import SplashScreen from "./components/SplashScreen";`
3. **Replace `<StartHere />` with `<SplashScreen />`**
4. **Watch the screen update instantly** — no save needed!

### 💡 Why This Matters

**Components** are the building blocks of **React** web apps — kind of like digital LEGO pieces. You build apps by snapping them together.

You probably noticed the `.jsx` file extension. That's because these **components** are written in a special syntax called **JSX**. It looks a lot like HTML, but is actually JavaScript under the hood. JSX lets you describe what the UI should look — using a syntax that's readable like HTML but powered by JavaScript.

The live update "magic" you experienced is actually powered by a build tool we are using called **Vite**, which uses a process known as **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** to apply "smart updates" to your app instantly as you code.

<a id="update-the-page-title"></a>

## 🏷️ Update the Page Title

Even though React apps are built with components, they still use a standard HTML file as the entry point. Let's update the page title to reflect our project name.

1. **Open `index.html`**
2. **Update the `<title>` tag** to: `Wizcamp Realms - Legends of Trivia`
3. **Confirm the browser tab** displays the new title.

### 💡 Why This Matters

A descriptive page title is important for usability, accessibility, and SEO. It helps users identify your app when they have multiple tabs open and improves discoverability in search engines.

## 📚 Essential Terms

_Quick reference for all the tools and concepts you just experienced:_

| Term                            | Definition                                                                                                             | Why it matters                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ☁️ Codespace                    | A cloud dev environment from GitHub — a ready-made VS Code workspace that runs in your browser.                        | You'll launch this first; it gives everyone the same setup so you can jump straight to coding.              |
| 🖥️ VS Code                      | Your coding headquarters — think Photoshop but for building apps instead of editing photos.                            | This is where the magic happens. File explorer, code editor, terminal — all in one place.                   |
| 🔧 Node.js                      | JavaScript that runs on your computer (not just in browsers) — like having a JavaScript engine everywhere.             | Powers your dev tools and lets you run `npm` commands. It's JavaScript unleashed.                           |
| 📦 npm                          | Node's package manager — installs libraries and runs scripts (`npm run dev`).                                          | Use it to install dependencies and start the dev server.                                                    |
| ⚡ Vite                         | The Ferrari of dev servers — crazy fast and makes your app load instantly during development.                          | When you run `npm run dev`, Vite serves your app at lightning speed. You'll see why it's so popular.        |
| 🔁 Hot Module Replacement (HMR) | Updates only the changed code in the browser without a full reload, often keeping app state.                           | Lets you see edits instantly (CSS/JS) while you work — you'll notice changes apply without losing progress. |
| ⚛️ React                        | A library for building UIs out of components; it updates the UI when data changes.                                     | The project is a React app — you'll edit components to change what users see.                               |
| ✨ JSX                          | JavaScript syntax that looks like HTML — used to describe UI in React components (`.jsx`).                             | You'll edit `.jsx` files (e.g., `src/App.jsx`) to swap components and change UI.                            |
| 🧩 component                    | A reusable piece of UI that can include markup, styles, and logic (example: `<SplashScreen />`).                       | You'll replace a placeholder component with `SplashScreen` to practice editing and imports.                 |
| 🌐 Document Object Model (DOM) | The browser's object model of the page — JS code (including React) reads and updates the DOM to change what users see. | React updates the DOM when you change components or state (e.g., button clicks, title updates).             |
