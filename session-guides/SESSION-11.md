## ⚡ GitHub Copilot Workflow

Use this workflow from Session 9 for each extension:

### How to Use Copilot Chat Effectively

1. Use a Copilot chat command like `/fix`, `/explain`, or `/test`
2. Write a clear, focused prompt describing what you want
3. Review the suggestion Copilot generates
4. Apply the change if it meets your needs
5. Test the update to confirm it works

### Example Prompt Sequence

```text
/fix Import Orbitron, Roboto, and Inter from Google Fonts into fonts.css.
```

followed by

```text
/fix Update all fontFamily references:
- Orbitron for game logo title
- Roboto for zone map labels
- Inter for UI elements
```

**Good Prompts Follow the 3S's:**

- **Simple:** Use clear, direct language
- **Specific:** Say exactly what you want
- **Short:** Focus on one task at a time
